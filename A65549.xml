            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>I rather prefix this Recognition to the ensuing Discourse, than to either of the other in its company, because, Sir, it was truly the <hi>sense</hi> I had of Your <hi>piety,</hi> which first ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated towards the reconciling me to <hi>Church-Musick.</hi> I came to You with prejudices (very unreasonable, such as commonly all prejudices are) against it: The first Organ I ever saw or heard, was in Your House, which was in those dayes a more regular Church than most we had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly. I then thus judged, if a man of such real Devotion, as I knew You to be of, would keep an Organ for sacred Ʋse, even when it was interdicted and of dangerous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb facs="tcp:40528:4"/> there was certainly more of reason for it, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceableness in it, than I apprehended. When afterwards God was pleased to <hi>bring again the Captivity</hi> of our <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> the <hi>English Church,</hi> my own experience soon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that those my favourable thoughts were most just: and now I have thought my self concern'd to tell the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate World so much.</p>
                  <p>I have, Sir, no other recompence to make, which You will accept, for all Your antient care and real kindnesses to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, than this poor acknowledgment, together with my serious prayers for a full Retribution to You from Him, who <hi>sees in secret, but will reward openly.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>EVery man (especially if of the Function I am of) is bound to do, what in conscience he thinks he can, for the <hi>publick good;</hi> This is all the Plea I have for writing on these Subjects: And if men are not either <hi>disorderly troublesome,</hi> or abominably <hi>self-flatterers,</hi> their <hi>Endeavours</hi> of this kind amongst all good men are usually <hi>well accepted,</hi> or <hi>easily pardoned;</hi> This has made me hope, with the better sort, a <hi>candid Reception.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For even as to those particular<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> wherein I may seem most to have exceeded what became my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and place, and especially in the <hi>presumption</hi> of the <hi>Dedication,</hi> I can safely avow, next to the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Duty I owe to their Eminencies, I had no more solemn end therein, than by putting my Book into so <hi>great hands,</hi> to <hi>secure</hi> its doing <hi>all the service</hi> 'tis capable of. If my Zeal for Reall and Regular Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may conciliate to this my Ambition, and to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Freedom I have used, a favourable censure, I shall rejoice: if it do not, such is the uprightness of my intention, that whatever shall be the success, I have nothing to repent of in my Undertaking (as far as I know) but my insufficient Performances.</p>
                  <p>Of these possibly there is no man more intimately sensible than my self.</p>

                  <p>But the Alterations I could desire, I would not have understood touching any Doctrinals I maintain, or the Expedients I offer to publick benefit: my meaning is onely touching particular expressions, diverse superfluous repetitions, allegations, proofs, and some punctilio's, which yet, it may be, all men will not take notice of.

I affirm further, It is certain the <hi>Publick Hymns</hi> in the Primitive Christian Church were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the then present estate by the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> In all these things, I am very constant to my own no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions if I be aright apprehended▪ That the term Psalms, when the Apostle bids the faithfull to <hi>Teach, speak to and admonish one another in Psalms,</hi> to the end <hi>The word of God may dwell plentifully in them,</hi> may be interpreted of, or chiefly applied to, the book of Psalms, <hi>I</hi> see no reason to oppose: but that both that term, and the other two, <hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>Spirituall songs,</hi> are to be understood solely thereof I do not see any Logick or Grammar <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>enders so much as highly Probable; and therefore if this intrepreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be <hi>probable,</hi> it must be onely <hi>in the lowest rank.</hi> Again, I am as fully perswaded, that our Lord on the crosse used the Initiall word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of the two and twentieth Psalm, as that he was crucified; but that he then used the whole, or the greatest part of that Psalm, I can s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>arce look upon as probable: I could therefore give these <hi>conjectures</hi> no more favourable name, than that of <hi>Probables of the lowest rank,</hi> that is, onely not impossible. Lastly as to the <hi>Great
<pb facs="tcp:40528:10"/> Hallelujah,</hi> it is most likely indeed our Lord might use it: for celebrateing a Jewish feast after the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish fashion, and amongst the Jewish people, who can think but he used the us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>all Jewish Hymn? which (at least, as yet) was no wise improper. But to argue thus, Because one term may with good reason be applied chiefly to <hi>Davids</hi> Psalms, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both it and two more were expressly designed touching them; or to derive the Orderly singing the whole book of Psalms in course, either from our Lords, or his and his Disciples, occasionall use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some small passages or parcels out of it; or from thence, that the Apostles probably did prescribe to the Primitive Christians that they should speak to, teach and admonish one another in the words of those Psalms, as occasion privately offered, is as <hi>Bad Logick</hi> as a man need to be guilty of. A thing may be true, and yet not a fit argument to prove all, for which it shall be pleaded. And this was truly my sense</p>
                  <p>As to the number of Psalms, which make up the great Hallelujah, I have indeed expressly varied, allotting thereto six Psalms pag: 230. and but five pag: 336. but for this variation I have great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours to produce; and which party are in the right, I acknowledg my selfe not able to determin; have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

All I can say is, that diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peruseing those Psalms I judged most probable, that it consisted onely of five, <hi>viz.</hi> Psalm 114, 115, 116, 117, 118: but herein I durst not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
<pb facs="tcp:40528:10"/> and therefore made use of both opinions; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which I thought most likely I put last, as my Second thoughts; makeing my judgment herein from the subject matter of the Psalms. If on the other side we will judge from the name <gap reason="foreign">

There are notwithstanding amongst us, of late years, not a few serious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderative men (persons of real Piety and worth) whom, the constant use of another way of serving God, ever since they knew what Religion meant, has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced against this; and the confidence of their way being best, has never suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to look deep enough into the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of another. This their confidence has commonly two very plausible, but insufficient, that I say not treacherous supports: a superficial or seeming sense of some passages of Scripture which they at first h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

These men, being (as above supposed) of upright and honest hearts, truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious

                     <p>That in our Publick Worship, which such persons bear most uneasily, is the neglect of what they call the <hi>Gift of Prayer,</hi> and the use of what we call <hi>Church Musick.</hi> Exceptions possibly there are against our <hi>preaching,</hi> but those less, and perhaps by persons less consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable: however, the charges against that, are of a different nature from what is objected against these, and shall be considered also by themselves. Our Sermons usually take with them much
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40528:21"/> better, than either the Liturgy, or the Choral use of it: In both these they think and say, we have laid aside the Primitive pattern. In the one, they complain, we retain nothing of the Apostolical spirit; in the other, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve not the Apostolical simplicity.</p>
                     <p>Now we will enter into a free and distinct consultation of each. We will search what is certainly Apostolical, and what the Scripture directs touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each, their management, their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ends and design. We will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the expediency and congruity of all to the present state, the measures which the Church has taken in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Ages, her perpetual use and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice all along. We will perform the whole with all openness, candour and sincerity, without fear, or favour of our own part, leaving what we do to approve it self to every Readers reason and conscience in the sight of God, and desiring onely to be received with the same unprejudicate mind, with which we have written.</p>

                     <p>When in any Discourse the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or subject of it is plainly exprest or propounded in the beginning, if it shall so come to pass, that in process any ambiguous or equivocal terms drop, they may be surely determined or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted by the Analogy they have to the common subject treated of. Whereas therefore the Apostle St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the XII Chapt. of his first to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ver. 1. propounds to treat touching spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Gifts. (<hi>Now concerning spiritual gifts, Brethren, I would not have you ignorant</hi>) and carries on that Discourse for three Chapters together, as is most evident, when in the XIV. Chapter ver. 15. we read, <hi>I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.</hi> It is plain that by <hi>spirit</hi> we are to understand a spiritua! Gift (the Meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymy is easie) for of spiritual Gifts the whole Discourse principally proceeds; and forasmuch as he applieth this Gift to Prayer, [<hi>I will pray with</hi> (or by) <hi>the spirit</hi>] it is certain he affirms a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual gift there was, then in the Church, facilitating in the Office of Prayer.</p>
                     <p>There are sundry other places which<note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note>

                        </gap>arr from enforceing any exposition, which will concern utterance in praier, that the scope of them seemes to restrain them clearly to another thing, as shall be shewn in an other part of this discourse more pertinent to the sense o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> those Texts. There is yet another passage which some have laid great weight on, as being a promise from our Lords own
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40528:22"/> mouth <hi>Math: X. 19, 20. When they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver you up, take no thought, how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak, For it is not ye that speak, but the spirit of your Father that speaketh in you.</hi> Hence they would frame an argument, <hi>à fortiori,</hi> thus: Would God assist them to plead at an heathen Tribunal, and not at the throne of Grace? But the answer is plain. He did undoubtedly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist those, to whom this promise was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at both, and that by the infallible conduct of his spirit: But yet neither is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance at both here promised, nor doth the promise belong to us, our case, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>imes, but to those primary and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Martyrs or Witnesses of Christianity. And being it is designed by our Lord to that particular case of answering for themselves, when arraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their Christianity, there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son we should extend it to what we list. In those cases it was not them who spoke, but the Holy Ghost in them. Those their apologies or defences being (as Scripture) given by inspiration of God, were of the same authority, with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40528:23"/> Scripture, and are many of them at this day Scripture. As is St. <hi>Peters, Acts</hi> IV, ver: 8 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and chap. V, ver. 29. And St. <hi>Stephens, Act.</hi> VII: And divers of St. Pauls. <hi>Acts</hi> XXII. and again chap. XXIII, and XXIV, ver. 10 <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and XXVI, ver. 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Behold in all these (and more instances that might be alleged) the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise verified; and the effect, Defences of infallible verity, as proceeding im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the Holy Ghost speaking in the Apologists. But will any man in his wits admit or urge this consequence? Our Lord promised by miraculous inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to assist His Apostles, when ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned before heathen judges for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing his Gospel, so that they should be able without thought to make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences of themselves and Doctrine, of divine and infallible authority: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in every ordinary case of prayer he will assist all the faithfull by the same inspiration. Or will these very persons arrogate thus much to themselves and their own prayers, that they proceed from the same, that is infallible, inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? It must, in all charity, be affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of them, that they will not.</p>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:40528:23"/>
                     <p>In the mean time, though these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces<note place="margin">Sect: 4.</note> infer no such thing, yet we have said, that the Apostle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly speaks of praying by a certain spiritual Gift, and that the same ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>not reasonably be gainsayed, by any who consider his discourse in the Chapters cited. Now touching this <hi>Gift of Prayer</hi> (as it is termed) and the grounds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (a case, which hath made more noise and trouble in the <hi>English</hi> Church, than in the whole Christian world) we will inquire, (1.) What is the strict import of the Gift, which the Apostle speaks of in that passage to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the onely place which can be proved to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to this matter. 2. What Rules the Apostle in that discourse laies down for the use or management of that <hi>gift?</hi> 3. Whether what has been by the late age, or is by this, called the <hi>Gift of praier,</hi> be the same gift, which is there mentioned by the Apostle. 4. If there should be found reason to conclude the spiritual Gift there spoken of to be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, miraculous, and proper to those times, whether then any Ordinary Gift of prayer, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nswerable to that Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40528:24"/> one, be of perpetuity in the Church, and a common consequent of a Gracious heart, as some have affirmed. 5. Whether conceived prayer, or pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by such an ordinary pretended gift, have in publick, any advantages of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed Forms? And lastly, what has been the certain Practice of the Church all along in this case?</p>
                     <p>In all which weighty Enquiries (for such they are now become) I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein my selfe from a second passionate beseeching, and in the name of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring, all who shall give themselves the pains to peruse this discourse, that they read with the same equanimity and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced sense with which I write, who, I thank God, ly under no tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to plead for one kind of prayer more than the other, any further than the meer merit of the cause shall turn the ballance.</p>
                     <p>As to the first matter of enquiry. It hath been already said and proved, that<note place="margin">Sect. 5.</note> Praying with the <hi>Spirit</hi> (1 Cor. 14.) signifies praying by a spiritual gift faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litating in that Office: Now the great question will be what is the strict impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40528:24"/> of the Spiritual gift there design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</p>
                     <p>In answer thereunto, we will readily allow in the <hi>general,</hi> that it was an Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to make and utter, anew and upon the sudden, a Prayer suiting to the then present state of Christianity. And for proof hereof we will desire no other evidence (as indeed none that is to be had can be more proper) than what the Apostles own words, taken in their true dependances, and with reference to the design of his discourse, carry in them. And the consideration hereof, besides the proving what we alledge it for, will lead us to a more <hi>particular,</hi> and indeed the strictest sense of that spiritual Gift there said to be serviceable in Prayer.</p>
                     <p>It is to be known then, that in those extraordinary dayes, God was pleased to inspire many of the Faithful peculiarly with the gift of divers Tongues. And this variety of Tongues, in men that had not learnt them, was not onely a meanes to propagate the Gospell in Countries remote and of a different lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage from that of the Jewes, but a signal proof and confirmation of that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40528:25"/> Gospell's being from Heaven, Heaven by such a miracle giving witness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. This is what we read in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter alledged, ver: 22. <hi>Tongues are for a sign not to them that believe, but to them that believe not.</hi> And the History of the effusion of this miraculous Gift, in several instances, we have in the Acts of the Apostles.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40528:25"/> many of them then could not, ver. 13. Having thus asserted the unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>praying</hi> by the Spirit when they understood not, he proceeds, in the Fifteenth verse, as to consultation. <hi>What is it then? I will pray with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and I will pray with the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also:</hi> that is, By this inspired gift of Tongues would I be able to utter Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, but so, that I understood distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what I uttered, and were not <hi>as things without life, giving sound, as pipes, or harps, or trumpets,</hi> and like instruments, ver. 7, 8. <hi>Praying in (or by) the spirit</hi> then, in the Apostles sense (or the spiritual gift there spoken of) signifies an inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red faculty of uttering a new Prayer, and that sometimes even in strange and different Tongues.

                     <p>The <hi>Corinthians</hi> were many of them zealous Affecters of those miraculous gifts then frequent amongst them: but particularly and above the rest of this prodigious gift of Tongues.

To this purpose he compares the gift of Tongues whereof they were so eager and fond, with other spiritual gifts of a more edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying nature; namely, with prophesying (or expounding the Scriptures of the Old Testament, the new one not being then extant) and with interpreting of tongues, and yet by no meanes under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing even that their admired Gift of Tongues: whereof therefore he sets down the usefullness in two points.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40528:26"/> First in regard of private edification, ver. 4. <hi>He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself.</hi> And, Secondly, in order to the conversion of infidels. ver: 22. <hi>Tongues are a sign:</hi> a verifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of old prophesies (such as <hi>Isai: XXVIII,</hi> 11. cited by our Apostle ver: 21. and that of <hi>Joel II,</hi> 28. cited by St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Acts II,</hi> ver▪ 16.) to convert the Jewes, who received those prophesies, but yet believed not the Gospel; and a supernatural effect or miracle for the perswading the Heathen world of the Divinity of Christian Doctrine. But together that the justice of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison might appear, he sets down also the comparative uselessnesse of this gift in two other points, the former of more private concerment: The mans own understanding many times was unfruitful. <hi>ver.</hi> 14: the latter of a larger extent, others (already convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) understood not those tongues, were not commonly edified <hi>ver. 5, 6. &amp;c.</hi> and could not to such praises say Amen▪ <hi>ver.</hi> 16. Wherefore this Gift of tongues was not so excellent, that is so usefull to the Church as prophesying, or interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40528:27"/> of tongues, no not if applied to this special office of prayer, wherein all ought to beare a part, at least by their <hi>Amen</hi> or consent, which how could they give to what they did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand?</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole consultation the text is the result, as is evident by the very manner of speaking, or the initial Formulary. <hi>What is it then?</hi> In other words, what shall we determine in this case? To which it is returned by way of resolve. <hi>I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,</hi> and with the understanding both of my selfe and of them who hear me. <hi>ver:</hi> 2, 9, 16, 19. In other terms: I account the faculty or gift of uttering an inspired prayer for the service of the Church in the publique worship of God, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireable and of excellent use in the Church; yea even those prayers, which<note place="margin">

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40528:27"/> forth as they are not understood, so farr forth are they uselesse to the Church, any otherwise than as miracles. By <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>his account it is plain both what this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Gift was, and that it was such as we have above determined.</p>
                     <p>To proceed therefore now to the<note place="margin">Sect. 6.</note> consideration of the Rule given by the Apostle for the publick management of this gift. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. The searching the distinct and full import of these words [<hi>I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also</hi>] will make out the summe and particulars of the Apostles Rule.</p>
                     <p>The summe is: Gifts indeed are not to be despised or neglected? But above all gifts, above all dexterity, neatness, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piousness, nay above all miracles of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage (for of such gifts there spoke he) we ought to be sollicitous, even in our publick prayers, that our minds and hearts be all along discinctly intent and employed. Words, though inspired ones, are of little virtue or worth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the concurrence and ingagement of the mind. Indeed the designe of words
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40528:28"/> in prayer, as to God-wards (who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands our thoughts without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour indications of them) is but to fix the Soul, to give distincter form and maturity to its acts, and to keep it staid to the particulars of its devotions. They are but the Vehicles of the souls breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Transports. By them our minds do <hi>elabi sursum ac evolare,</hi> glide forth and soar aloft to that God, whom the infinite tendencies of soules, rather than pittiful limited sounds, which dy with our breath, can reach and move. Wherefore, though they are to be used (both upon account of the reasons mentioned, and Divine command) yet all speech, all gifts or faculty thereof, are so far onely valuable &amp; useful, as they serve to engage the mind in affection and duty to God.</p>
                     <p>To reduce this into distincter mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. First, it is considerable that the Apostle no wise undervalues or teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to neglect the spiritual gift, which was then so miraculously frequent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them: which because it was onely (<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40528:29"/> under the Gospell the state of things was changed, and he now without those shadowes required the sacrifice of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and pure hearts, he haveing first accepted the immaculate sacrifice of his onely Son upon the Crosse, by the sweet savour whereof all our sacrifices both of hearts and devotions must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come acceptable, he I say, forasmuch a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

What they had by extraordinary inspiration, we have by more ordinary meanes and methods, of which we shall speak hereafter▪ When therefore he wills, that those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired persons <hi>Pray with the spirit,</hi> that is, make use of their inspiration in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by parity of reason, I say, he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, we, in our state, imploy our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian prudence, care and skill, that our prayers be meet and pertinent to the present condition of the Church &amp; of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40528:29"/> our selves. And that, as above intimated,</p>
                     <p>First, as to the matter of them. We are not presently to vent, what first offers it selfe to our ranging phansy. Things ought to be examined, and choice made, and care taken, that in our confessions we charge not on our selves sins, which we do not think our selves guilty of: that again in our peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we neither ask things unlawful, nor indecent, nor for ill ends to <hi>spend on our lust:</hi> that finally in our doxolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, and all addresses of invocation, admiration, praise, or vow to God, we ascribe not or promise to him things unbecomeing his pure nature and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Majesty. The very law of nature as well as Holy writt▪ requires thus much. <hi>Eccle.</hi> V. 2. <hi>Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God</hi> (which he presseth by naturall reason) <hi>For God is in heaven and thou on earth.</hi>

                        </gap>rds and expressions, none can conceive, but Christian prudence and care is to be used; for as much as it is certain, the mind closely follows the words and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40528:30"/> conceives and understands thinges by them. It must needs therefore be, that irreverent, absurd or uncomely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions lead aside or disturb true devotion.

                        </gap> some care &amp; thought) <hi>to choose out words to plead with God. Job:</hi> IX. 14. I will therefore onely adde, that what ever interest or Familiarity any man can conceive himself to have with God, loose and carelesse language in Prayer, must needs bespeak a certain want of the fear of God in him, who uses it; and most especially in Publick, where every expression may be presumed to have an
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40528:30"/> influence on many hearts, either to quicken or infect them.</p>
                     <p>Thus then stands the first member of the Apostles rule; that, whereas the Corinthians had an immediate inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then assisting many of them in prayer, they should not neglect it: which can concern our times, and state no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise than thus; that, whereas we have onely Christian prudence and usual utterance, which are the gift (though but common gift) of Gods spirit, we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect not the use of these, in providing, according to our ability, that our prayers be meet and fit, both in matter and form. I doe not see how any thing more can reasonably be infered hence:</p>
                     <p>The other branch of his rule is this, that all gifts, which are exercised in publick prayers, ought to be so regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated or managed, as that the prayers, made thereby, be understood, both by the person that presents them, and the congregation of Auditors, who are to joyne therein. This is clearly his sense, <hi>I will pray with the spirit,</hi> (as before said) <hi>but I will pray with the understanding also,</hi> the point we now urge. He allowes
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40528:31"/> that even the very gift of strange tongues, (for of that gift particularly as we have seen he speaks) might be used in prayer; but first, by such who vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood it themselves, that so while their spirit prayed, their understanding might not be unfruitfull V: 14. And, secondly, if amongst the unlearned, then with interpretation, that so, <hi>they who occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied the room of the unlearned might say Amen.</hi> V. 16. They were to use the gift of tongues, that the benefit of a new miracle might redound to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating or confirming the beliefe of Christianity; but they were to interpret, that the prayers, which they conceived, might not be of their private spirit, but being understood by all, ingage distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the devotion of the whole Church. And the necessity of this later is most evident. For, how is it possible the mind can go along with, consent to, and be distinctly affected with, what it does not understand? Can any man, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves to speak reason or sense, call the muttering over of words, which he does not understand, a reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able service? This is a strange <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40528:31"/> God in spirit and in truth,</hi> to pay him such a service, which cannot possibly have any truth in it, that is any conformity of my mind with my words, because I understand them not; nay, concerning which I do not know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be an act of Worship or of Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemy, <hi>whether I bless or curse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The consideration of this, I confess, creates in me not a little wonder at those of the Romish Church; that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all Scripture, reason, truth of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, nay even against common sense, they should magnifie, maintain and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice (even after these miraculous gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>s have long ceased) Prayer in an unknown Tongue: and this in a manner constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in their most solemn and serious Offices. That their common Priests amongst us should affirm, that no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Nation before the Reformation u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to have the publick Service in any but the Latine Tongue, I do not at all admire, because I am satisfied by suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient experience, that many of them do not understand what is Latine and what not▪ (Hebrew or Greek words, when writ in a Latine Character, are
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40528:32"/> sufficiently Latine with them: and this, as to many passages in their Offices they will face us down in, before their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous people, and call us ignorant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we know better) But that any of them who pretend to Learning and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation should say so, I cannot but stand amazed; when even their own Breviaries, their Ritual, nay the very Canon of the Mass it self have all along not onely several Hebrew and Greek words, but some passages intirely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out variation taken out of the old Greek Liturgies (and therefore must needs suppose them in being before them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves) and besides several Greek Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, which certainly were once in use, have we not to this day extant the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy of the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> of the <hi>Aethiopick</hi> &amp; <hi>Armenian</hi> Churches, &amp; many others which perhaps I never heard of?</p>
                     <p>But to let these Gentlemen pass: while we reprehend Adversaries, it is necessary we be just and constant to our selves. I must needs confess, amongst those who call themselves Protestants and Reformed, and who would be thought to be of us, since there have
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40528:32"/> been so many pretenders to the Gift of prayer, they have made this sacred Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of prayer, as they perform it, very unintelligible: if they do <hi>pray with the spirit,</hi> so; I am sure they do not <hi>pray with the understanding,</hi> at least of those who hear them. I must avow, I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand Non-sense, nor distinctly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend mens meaning in broken sense, or their blundering confused aiming at sense: and I could wish, that most of the prayers of the gifted men were not too often fraught herewith. I am well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured also, that most of the common people do not understand terms of art, nor new and affected words and phrases, and so that they cannot to one half of such mens prayers say <hi>Amen.</hi> I might also say, that by their frequent exple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, by their often being at a loss, by their undigested and inconsistent expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, their uttering at a peradventure what comes next; it is evident, that they themselves many times do not distinctly understand, what they would have. If therefore we will keep to this member of the Apostles Rule, it is plain we can no more justifie such prayers as these,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40528:33"/> than the former practice which we have reprehended, &amp; which even these men themselves do reprehend, in our Elder Adversaries of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There may be yet conceived a third branch in this the Apostles rule, though indeed it may rather seem a consectary from what he saies, than matter of his plain design.

                        </gap>, when it is as we would have it. Besides there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son assignable, why the Apostle should require, that men pray with the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, but because that being the leading part of the soul, draws the will &amp; unites all the powers of the Soul upon
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40528:33"/> God. <hi>To pray</hi> then <hi>with the mind</hi> (as the word imports or may infer) will be to pray with real <hi>inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and all good affection, in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Scripture, to pray <hi>with all our heart, with all our Soul, and with all our Strength.</hi> And when the Apostle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves, we ought so to pray with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that we pray also <hi>with the mind,</hi> he would that all spiritual gifts, servicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in prayer, be so managed, as that the prayers made thereby be not onely comprehended by the understanding, but also may make impression upon the will and affections, and draw and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the whole Soul God-wards, by the exercise of all those Christian graces which are proper to the respective parts of prayer. I do not say this was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly intended here by St. <hi>Paul;</hi> but it is fairly enough deducible from what he did directly intend, and from his expresse terms.</p>
                     <p>And this is truly what the Scripture<note place="margin">

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40528:34"/> and seriously intending and being bent on the matters exprest, is affected sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably to the nature of each; confessing sins with sorrow &amp; contrition for them, with hatred of them, with resolution against them; and with the same temper most passionatly begging pardon and grace, and together being resolved to endeavour by all meet means to obrain &amp; await the graces petitioned for; again, interceding for others with servent charity and good will. That this is the genuin sense thereof cannot more fitly be proved, than by considering, in the first place, what the <hi>Spirit of prayer,</hi> which was promised, was. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise we have most largely and perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuously in <hi>Zech:</hi> XII, 10. <hi>I will pour upon the House of David, and upon the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Jerusalem, the spirit of Grace of supplications; &amp; they shall look upon me whom they have peirced &amp; they shall mourne for him as one mourneth for an onely Son; &amp; shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for an onely Son.</hi> Nothing can be more plain by the very letter of a Text, than that the Blessing here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised was a complication of the graces
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40528:34"/> of Gods spirit, contrition, faith divine love, and whatever else makes up the ardent devotion of a penitent heart; rather than any gifts of utterance, none of which haply would suffice for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing such passionate effusion of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as is in the context repraesented It is in direct terms first styled the <hi>spirit of grace,</hi> a penitent, affectionate, broken heart▪ and by being such, a <hi>spirit of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,</hi> plurally, that temper being lowder in the eares of God, than all vocall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> instance (I. <hi>Sam.</hi> I. 10, 13) in the case of <hi>Hannah.</hi> And if that passage of St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> VIII 26, be to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood (as some would have it) touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such an inward assistance of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, as all the faithfull may expect in prayer, it must certainly be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in proportion to this prophesy. He had said (ver: 24, 25) That under all their pressures and groanes it was <hi>Hope</hi> that supported them; and that by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them to patience: upon which immediately he proceeds (ver: 26) <hi>Likewise the spirit also helpeth our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities;</hi> when our very hopes are
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40528:35"/> weake and languishing, we receive a secret supply of comfort from the Holy Ghost wonderfully affecting our hearts, and by that meanes supporting us. <hi>For we know not what to pray for as we ought.</hi> In these <hi>deliquia,</hi> or fainting fits, we are many times at a losse, whether we ought to ask the removall of our cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, or no. <hi>But the Spirit it self ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth intercession for us with groanes, which cannot be uttered.</hi> The same Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, in these straits, works our minds to such ineffable heights of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and casting our selves upon God, as do undoubtedly prevail with God to give us what is best, though we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther positively aske the one nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but refer the whole to the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pleasure of our heavenly Father.</p>
                     <p>This is I profess as naturally as I can represent it (to make the verse any way consistent whith the Apostles dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course) the sense of that verse, takeing it even of the spirit inwardly assisting the faithfull in prayer: though it seemes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be meant of the spirit dwelling in Christ, <hi>who sits at the right hand of God making intercession for us,</hi> for
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40528:35"/> which I could alledge severall reasons, were it to the present designe. Upon the whole then, takeing this verse, even in favour of our adversaries, the Apostle expressly affirmes, that the great assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, which we receive from the Holy Ghost in prayer, is, its <hi>makeing inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for us withgroanes which cannot be uttred;</hi> referring the assistance to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward devotion wrought by the Holy Ghost, and too great for the utterance of words, and not to any gifts of utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or expressions.</p>
                     <p>Having thus considered what the <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of prayer</hi> is, in the sense of Scripture, and what the great assistance which the Faithful may expect in prayer from the spirit, for further proof that the notion above given is the fittest, which can be put on those phrases of <hi>praying in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, and prayer in the spirit,</hi> let the places where they are found be lookt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with regard to the connexion and design of each. In <hi>Ephes. VI.</hi> from <hi>ver.</hi> 10, to the 17. (inclusively) the Apostle conjures his Ephesians, considering the variety of dangers and difficulties in their Christian warfare (set down <hi>

                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:40528:36"/> 12) that they should endeavour all courage and constancy; and to that purpose <hi>Arme,</hi> or endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, themselves by the <hi>Truth,</hi> and a <hi>righteous</hi> or holy life (ver: 14) by Charity, <hi>Faith, and Hope</hi> (ver: 15, 16, 17.) <hi>Praying alwaies with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance:</hi> in other &amp; shorter terms, praying with all fervour and constancy; or with the exercise of all those Christian graces, and as men inspirited with supernatural devotion. And if that passage of St. <hi>Jude</hi> has any thing in it peculiar and distinct from this sense, it is onely with relation to the publick assemblies, and prayer therein. He had warned the faithfull (ver: 19) <hi>of those who separated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, sensual men, haveing not the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> [brutish persons, void of grace or any principle of a new life] <hi>But</hi> (ver: 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.) <hi>ye beloved, building up your selves on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Ghost, keep your selves in the love of God.</hi> [In stead of separating, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the publick assemblies, for your daily growth in grace, and joyn there
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40528:36"/> in prayer with all zeal and ardour of mind, thus keeping your selves in the favour and under the blessing of God in communion with his Church.] What any inspired gifts of utterance, supposed in the community of the faithful, have here to do (the publick and promiscuous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of which possibly might rather tend to schism and separation) it is not easy to conceive.</p>
                     <p>The result then, or the whole that<note place="margin">Sect. 8.</note> can be reasonably concluded, from all the places, which we have yet consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is, That there were, in the miraculous state of the Christian Church, certain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary gifts of utterance, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that of divers Tongues; that this was then used, and under some cautions use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, even in the Office of Prayer: that both then and ever the Holy Spirit of God, in a peculiar sort under the Gospel, sweetly moves, softens and quickens the hearts of the Faithful, as in other cases, so especially in prayer: that herein it raises in them greater fervour of love and good affection than naturally could be had or expected: that in all kind of Prayer the Faithful ought to endeavour
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40528:37"/> the exercise of the graces of Gods Spirit; And that finally, all publick Prayers are to be fitted, in the best manner that may be, to the general capacity and devotion of the Christian community.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE third point of Enquiry will<note place="margin">Sect. 1.</note> take up less time for satisfaction: namely, Whether what has been by the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40528:37"/> late Age named, and is now called usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, the <hi>Gift of prayer,</hi> be the same with that spiritual Gift spoken of in the place aforementioned?</p>
                     <p>For answer whereto, though it might seem requisite some definition or descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption should first be given of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Gift, yet I presume it for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent purpose sufficiently known by its name, and proceeding directly to the Question answer it in the Negative, that the Faculty called the <hi>Gift of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> and pretended to by those, who quarrel'd and withdrew from the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> was not at all the gift designed by S. <hi>Paul</hi> in 1 <hi>Cor. XIV,</hi> 15. the only place which yet I can find to speak of praying by a spiritual gift.</p>
                     <p>For, First, it is plain by the account already given of that place, that the Gift there spoken of was the gift of Tongues. In the first Chapter, we read the Corinthian Church to have been <hi>enriched in all utterance and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 5.</note> This gift of Tongues was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>species</hi> or kind of the Gift of ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance: but yet as particular as it was, it was no more appropriate to the Office
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40528:38"/> of <hi>prayer,</hi> than to that of <hi>singing:</hi> for it follows in that very place, <hi>I will pray with the spirit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstonding also.</hi> And no more to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these, than to the Office of <hi>preaching</hi> or <hi>speaking mysteries.</hi> For, <hi>ver. 2. He that speaketh in an unknown tongue, in the spirit speaketh mysteries;</hi> or, <hi>ver. 6. He speaketh either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:</hi> And again, <hi>ver. 26, He hath a psalm, hath a doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. Now it is certain, or will be confest, that this gift of Tongues was not the thing pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to in the Gift of prayer.</p>
                     <p>Again, it is acknowledged by all, that the Gift there spoken of was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and miraculous: and this destroyes the very pretense of those touching whom we speak. For though haply they would be content to be admired for their gift of prayer (and it may be some do really admire many of them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a fashion) yet was not this Gift pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended any miracle, but an usual conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent (at least in some measure) of grace, though sometimes incident even
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40528:38"/> unto reprobates also, and so more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary than a gracious heart it self.</p>
                     <p>But it will be demanded then, is<note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> there not some <hi>Ordinary</hi> Gift of prayer, answerable to to that Extraordinary one there spoken of, which was to be of perpetuity in the Church, and may be expected from the Holy Ghost by all the Faithfull, as being a common fruit of Conversion?</p>
                     <p>This is the fourth point of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded inquiry. And in answere hereunto, that terms may not involve us in obscurity, I must forbear no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to set down as inoffensively as I can, what can be the sober meaning of the Gift of prayer.</p>
                     <p>Now as to those who meant any thing<note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> sober and intelligble thereby, I conceive their meaning in ordinary language may be thus exprest. This gift they suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be a faculty, infused by the Holy Ghost, consisting of <hi>quickness of thought and readiness of speech,</hi> both particularly applied to the business of prayer. And this they would have reckoned amongst what they call the Common gifts of the spirit; because, though all are by then
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40528:39"/> supposed to have it in some measure who are truly converted and in whom the spirit dwells, yet many may receive from the spirit of God this and such like gifts (and in a greater measure too than some of their converts) who yet are void of the sincere and choice grace of Gods spirit: as <hi>Jadas</hi> may be conceived to have been indowed with spirituall Gifts qualifying him for his Apostleship and ministry, and yet still a reprobate, and farr from haveing an holy heart. This is, as distinctly as I can apprehend it, and as impartially as I can set it down, the sense of this pretended Gift. I call it a <hi>pretended gift,</hi> not but that I acknowledge such abilities, wherever they are, to come from the spirit of God in a common way; but I cannot admitt either that every faithfull man must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect such gifts so to be infused into him by the spirit, or that he must not be accounted faithfull, if he want them, or finally that such Gifts are more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the present and Christian state of the Church, than to any other former estate thereof whatsoever.</p>
                     <p>Now I humbly beseech all who shall
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40528:39"/> take the pains to read this, not to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with what I have said, or am now about to say for the bringing people to a clear understanding &amp; a sober judgment in this matter. Let us be content to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the case like men of reason, and in words of truth and plainenesse.</p>
                     <p>Suppose then I should tell the world<note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> that there is an Heathen art called <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick,</hi> and that there have been many naturall men of excellent abilities this way, as <hi>Aristotle, Cicero, Quintilian, Hermogenes,</hi> and many other masters, who bave long since written bookes of this art, teaching men to speake readily on any subject upon a sudden, &amp; that this has been known commonly amongst the heathen to have been effected in a most copious and eminent sort, exceeding farr what most (if not all) our preten<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ders to Gifts have attained to; Must not this be allowed to be truth? Suppose these men, long since dead, who never heard of Christ, or his spirit, or the gift thereof, could now heare us talke of Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ickness of thought, and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness of speech, as parts of a suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Gift of prayer, might not they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40528:40"/> presently stand up and lay claim to this gift? Nay and not onely so, but that they taught it, and have lest admirable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts for it; and that these two are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther better nor worse, than the result of two parts of <hi>Rhetorick</hi> (according to their doctrine) the names whereof are Notorious, <hi>Inventio &amp; Elocutio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Suppose I say further, that as the Philosopher hath observed that there is a Natural kind of Logick, which even unlearned men have, by which they reason and draw notable shrewd conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences (which our Neighbours very fitly call <hi>Mother<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> wit</hi>) so there is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral kind of Rhetorick (some men na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally are more quick both in thought and speech than others) must not this also be confessed as a truth?</p>
                     <p>I will onely add one thing more, that there is a kind of <hi>unartificial education</hi> and <hi>institution.</hi> When men <hi>converse</hi> much with persons, who are expert in art, and hear them frequently discourse of, and practise in▪ that art, if they have any <hi>natural parts</hi> themselves, they learn something from them, and setting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to <hi>imitate</hi> them, and <hi>practice</hi> by
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40528:40"/> the <hi>rules,</hi> they have had given them, they are presently able to do some little feats in that art themselves. Now, is there any thing strange in all this? Is not this what was known and taught in the Heathen World, long before the gift of prayer was thought of in the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, that all Arts and Sciences are attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Naturâ, praeceptis &amp; usu,</hi> by mens <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural parts</hi> upon <hi>institution</hi> and <hi>practice?</hi> I would fain hear of any, who attained the gift of prayer any otherwise than thus. Those who have been the sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Proficients, that I have heard of (I forbear any instances which look like od<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ous) have, to my knowledge, had persons, of great eminency in this way, labouring with them many dayes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, giving them methods (such as they were) and instructions for the use of them, putting words into their mouth, practising before them, setting them to practise themselves. And these things being notoriously known, what man, that has not sold himself to whimsies, and given up his reason to extravagant ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, can conceive or suppose in this case any infusion of a <hi>spiritual gift,</hi> or
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40528:41"/> must not rather acknowledge a <hi>common habit</hi> naturally acquired (I mean by usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and proper means) the like to which in any other case (<hi>caeteris paribus</hi>) may be had at any time; and in which there is no reason to conceive any other than a general influence and concourse of the Holy Ghost, such as in other matters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies mens exercise and industry.</p>
                     <p>Now upon the whole I demand, is it reasonable to take a piece of an ordinary art, famous even amongst Heathens, and applying it to a particular Christian Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to wit that of <hi>prayer,</hi> to disguise it by a new Christian name; and calling it the <hi>Gift of prayer,</hi> to make it presently a Fruit and sign of grace? If it had been onely said, that even Ordinary Oratory is a gift of the Spirit, it must have been acknowledged a truth; for so are all arts and sciences, not onely Liberal but even Mechanical (so was Embroidery Engravoure in <hi>Aholiah</hi> &amp; <hi>Bezaleel, Exod: XXXV,</hi> 31, 35; spinstry in the Women <hi>ver:</hi> 25, 26; Architecture in <hi>David 1. Chron: XXVIII,</hi> 11 12) But if men will pretend to have received this as a gift, by a sudden and more than usual
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40528:41"/> inspiration, and not to have come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, upon their natural parts, by heare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or reading discourses thereof, by heareing it practiced, by practiceing therein themselves, they abuse the world and themselves. And if they will make such things as these signes or fruits of grace, they are signes truly what the grace in them is, but somewhat un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily: they shew indeed, that though they may be good meaning men in this, and in other regards upright and sound, yet they are in spiritual matters marveil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously whimsicall, unreasonable and halfsighted; they distinguish not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Grace, Nature and Art.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sect: 5.</note>

                     <p>I may presume what has been said is sufficient to take off the pretence of any supernatural infused Gift, in this case ordinarily received, or to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by the faithfull. Now to shew, for a more full satisfaction to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry in hand, that this <hi>Gift,</hi> as they call it, was, as to its Essentiall parts, no more appropriate to prayer than to other Christian offices of like nature, I shall onely urge the Experience of that age, by giveing in short the General
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40528:42"/> history of the Processs of this Gift. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the great setters up hereof had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted this their gift of prayer to the people, that is, taught them to pray by the spirit or in the conceived way, did not those very people presently, by virtue of this their gift, that is, this readiness of thought and speech, begin to expound Scripture and to speak in their assemblies, as they call'd it? Was not this the way of proceeding? First they learnt to pray by gift: then haveing exercised this gift in private fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, they begun to repeat their lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers sermons, and by little &amp; little imitate them, as they had done their prayers. Then they took upon them to exhort and instruct private families, that is, they practiced in private, and thence proceded to speak in publick, trying first how they could come offin their way of prayer publickly; in which haveing succeded they stuck at nothing. Can it be pretended that the Gift was differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in one and the other exercise? Was it not the same faculty that qualified them for both? And has not this, or worse been, the education and in a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40528:42"/> manner sole erudition of many of them, who practice the ministry amongst those congregations, that withdraw from our Church. I have not written these thinges to vili<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And this, I say, is most evident demonstration that this Gift, as to its essence, is no more appropriate to <hi>Prayer</hi> than <hi>Preaching,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it capacitated those, who could pretend to nothing but gift, for both: and is, if we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

                     <p>But it will be said, allowing what we<note place="margin">Sect. 6.</note> call the Gift of prayer to be nothing else but an Habit of speech, at tainable by such means as has been said, yet may not we use this Habit of speech in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er so, as to conceive our prayers our selves in our own words?</p>
                     <p>I answer hereunto, Who doubts but we may?

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40528:43"/> of the whole Catholick Church, except our selves and our new (comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) inconsiderable party.</p>

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40528:44"/> use of such supposed Habit of speech in prayer as spoken of, it will be but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, and consonant to that Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, candour and openness, which I in the beginning promised in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse, to enquire further, Whether it were not more expedient, that the use of <hi>Conceived prayer</hi> in publick, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, or at least allowed and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, than that of <hi>prescribed</hi> Forms, by reason of the great advantage concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved prayer may be found or imagined to have, above any Formes whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                     <p>And for satisfaction hereto, I shall impartially consider the advantages of both kinds, and having compared both, <hi>I</hi> do not doubt but we shall find our Church, like her in the Gospel, to have <hi>chosen the better part, and which</hi> I hope <hi>shall never</hi> again <hi>be taken from her.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now to make the way more plain to a full and distinct satisfaction, <hi>I</hi> think it fit to premise three things,</p>
                     <p>First, That conducency to Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> is the onely measure, by which all advantages, conveniencies or profit are to be estimated in this case. If this need
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40528:44"/> any proof, greater cannot be required, than that it is made by the Apostle, in the same chapter which has hitherto been so serviceable to us, the great stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, according to which the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of all <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Offices</hi> in the publick Worship are to be examined. <hi>Letall things be done unto edification.</hi> The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there mainly taxt amongst them, was the use of spiritual Gifts, more to pomp and ostentation than a general good. <hi>How is it then brethren? When ye</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. <hi>XIV. 26.</hi>
                        </note>
                        <hi>come together, every one of you hath a Psalm, hath a Doctrine, hath a Tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation.</hi> Each glories in adventures of his own Gifts, and through affectation, or under pretence of improving each himself, in stead of consulting publick edification, you introduce publick confusion. Upon which immediately follows the passage now mentioned, <hi>Let all things be done unto edification.</hi> No exercise of Gifts in the Christian Assemblies is to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which conduces not to the common edification. So much then as either of these sorts of prayer edifies more than the other, so much of advantage
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40528:45"/> hath it of the other▪</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is necessary we take some<note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> account what is the real and true im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this term Edification: for it is to be acknowledged, <hi>Edifying</hi> is a term which the people much use, and little understand. It properly signifies <hi>Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as we know; and is onely Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically spoken of the soul, to signifie any advance, improvement or betterment of it in matters spiritual: and there being but two Faculties of the reasonable soul, capable of perfective habits or dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, namely, the <hi>understanding</hi> and the <hi>will,</hi> we may soon take an account par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, what can be the utmost notion or extent of <hi>Edification,</hi> when applied to spirituals. The Understanding is edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, when it is further inform'd or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the knowledge of some mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of worth or concernment. Thus Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication signifies improvement in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or (whlch is resolvible into the same) recovery of what was forgotten. The Will is edified, when it is drawn either to the love and practice of some Duty before neglected, or to the dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station and abandoning some sin before
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40528:45"/> adhered to. Thus Edification signifies improvement in holiness or good reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. In summe and most plainly; a man is then edified when he is made any whit the <hi>wiser</hi> or the <hi>better.</hi> and beyond this Edification is onely a Chimera, or well meaning mistake.</p>
                     <p>I do acknowledge the warmth of<note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> affection under holy Offices, the motion of Transient remorse and sorrow, fears, hopes, and joys, have been, and to this day are, mistaken by many honest (though weaker) persons for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est if not the onely Edification. When they have found their affections a little moved, perhaps to such pitch as that a tear has dropt, they have esteemed themselves singularly edified. Now though it must be allowed commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and happy, in general, to pray and hear with such tenderness of heart, yet it is a great and may be a very fatal er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, to take such passions for the graces of Gods spirit, or the motion thereof for solid and serious Edification. <hi>Felix</hi> we read <hi>trembled</hi> at <hi>St. Pauls</hi> preaching, yet had not therefore a jot more of the <hi>feare</hi> of God in him. They who are
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40528:46"/> resembled to the stony ground <hi>heard the word and anon with joy received it,</hi> but were notwithstanding as fruitless in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as they on the high way, who admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or regarded it not at all. And we know, how shallow some mens passions ly, howsoon they are come at, how easily stirred, and to how little purpose. St. <hi>Austins</hi> confession of his concernment even to teares for <hi>Dido</hi> in the Poeme, which he knew to be onely a Fable, is notorious: and every daies experience of effects of the like nature, upon occasions which I will not name, shewes, that to be moved with pathetick subjects and harangues is as common and natural, as it is usually fruitless. The utermost that is to be determined in the behalfe of these sensible commotions I conceive is, First, That if while a mans mind is really intent and seriously engaged in devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the more sensitive soule shall at that time conspire therewith in suitable affections, such devotions are a great deal more confortable to the performer, and he may be sure acceptable to God; it is an argument we serve God in such case with our whole man, according to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40528:46"/> that of <hi>David, my heart and my flesh</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal lxx. 2.</note>
                        <hi>rejoyceth in the liveing God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And, secondly, that these little parox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ysms of pious affections, even when comeing upon us more unawares, by their frequent returns or more lasting impressions, which some times they may make on the soul, may serve, as previous dispositions, to prepare the Soul to the hatred of sin, to the love of God, to a serious tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and steddy resolutuion of duty. But where they uncertainly come and go, where they neither proceed from a mind so imployed and engaged, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore said, nor prevail to imprint any thing on the mind for a change to the better (which God knowes is two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the case) they are triviall, and little or not at all to be valued, if not fallacious. Reall edification still may not be concluded more, than what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore resolved: so that the issue, in our present case to be tried, is no other than this, Which kind of prayer most conduces to the makeing men <hi>wiser</hi> or <hi>Holyer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And, lastly, it is to be considered by<note place="margin">Sect. 5.</note>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:40528:47"/> way of promise, that there may be a <hi>private</hi> edification of a mans <hi>self,</hi> as well as a <hi>publick</hi> edification of the <hi>Church;</hi> and that what may conduce to the one, may not equally contribute to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This is plain out of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned chapter to the <hi>Corinthians, ver: 3 and 4. He that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification and Exhortation and Comfort. He that speaketh in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the Church.</hi> The gift of tongues might edify the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular owner, but it did not so much edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the community of the Church, as other more intelligible gifts.</p>
                     <p>These things thus premised, I shall faithfully and impartially, upon long thought, and possibly some experience, endeavour to determin the case above putt, not at all detracting from the merits of what they call the gift of prayer</p>
                     <p>To begin with what may be said for<note place="margin">Sect. 6.</note> it: Conceived prayer hath these advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages,</p>
                     <p>First, it is ever <hi>New,</hi> and so more apt to gratify curiosity: and therefore those
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40528:47"/> who come not to the publick Worship out of sober Devotion, but Vanity or Custome, will more greedily come to it, and be less weary of it than prescribed Forms; its novelty both invitin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> it, and allaying somewhat the <hi>Taedium</hi> or wearisomness of its length. In a word, it serves to bring many such people to Church. And the same is the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why we have many Hearers of our <hi>Sermons,</hi> who will not at all come into the Congregation at the <hi>Service:</hi> The Sermon is always new; the Service is not. Now though such persons look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it as a great part of Religion in them to affect Sermons so zealously, yet it may be feared that this is one point which may be added to the Inventary of their mistakes, that they distinguish not herein, betwixt Curiosity and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Conceived Prayer may be sometimes more suited and apposit to the particular seasons and occasions, than the general prescribed Forms: But this according to the abilities of the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and as he is Master of phansie and speech, of consideration, invention and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40528:48"/> Elocution. And Thirdly, For these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons (namely, its Novelty allwayes, and Particularity sometimes,) it is more apt to affect common and more slighty minds. Their love, grief, compassion, joy, hopes, are more easily hereby stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Now these, though they are, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore said, very commendable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable withall, and well pleasing to God, when they proceed from sober de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and judgment, yet let any man of reason judge how useless, and of what deceitful and dangerous consequence, they may prove, when they have such an irrational rise, as from Novelty, Phansie and Humour.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, upon the former accounts it is easily admissible, that Conceived prayer may keep many persons more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to it, than they would be to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Forms. Yet so, that this attention cannot alwayes be accounted, nor is rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lly at first, true Devotion, or an act of direct Worship. It may proceed pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly from the Fear of God, and sense of his present Majesty, that I am so atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. But yet every act of Worship im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting a consent of the mind, and this
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40528:48"/> attention being in order to judgment, and that praevious to my consent, it is plain, the attention it self is not a direct act of Worship. For having attentively heard, inasmuch as all is new to me, I must first judge, whether what is in the name of the Congregation (and so in my name) presented to God, be generally approveable and suitable to my conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before I can say <hi>Amen</hi> thereto that is, before I can either offer it up my self, or consent that it shall be offered up for me. Now I say, this act of consent and intention being in this case the first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per act of Devotion or Worship, it is plain, that neither of the precedent acts, of Attention or Judgment, are strictly to be accounted such.</p>
                     <p>These I profess are the onely advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, which either my poor experience, consideration or reading suggest alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for Conceived prayer in preference to Prescribed Forms: It is more inviting and less tedious to some spirits, it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> sometimes more close and particularly apposit, it is more apt to affect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon minds, and to retain some kind of attention; and how farr all, or any of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40528:49"/> these, are advantages, has been under each head stated or intimated.</p>
                     <p>Now on the other side, to deal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously,<note place="margin">Sect. 7</note> it hath many inconveniencies, and such which concern both the Praier it selfe thus uttered, the Performer, and the congregation.</p>
                     <p>As to the prayer it selfe, that cannot be so complete and absolute as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it might be, both in regard of matter, form, and the consent, which it should have from the whole assembly to make it their joint supplication, or common act of worship. In regard of the matter, it must needs be much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. The generall concernments of a Christian assembly are numerous and yet weighty; and therefore need to be represented or sett forth, as neer as can be, it not in express terms (as is done excellently in our Church Litany) yet under such heads as naturally enough comprise them and suggest them to the peoples thoughts. Let any man be of never so happy consideration or ready memory, it is not likely, if possible, that upon the sudden or some little thought, he should make so just an enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40528:49"/> or even summulary of them, as is necessary; especially supposeing that commonly he is to vary expressions, if not method. He must needs omit many things necessary to be confest, asked, or given thankes for, through unavoidable lapse of memory, and being (possibly) more affected and carried away with other points.</p>
                     <p>And in this case, I appeal to any, who have been but in a tolerable measure seriously conversant in this kind of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in private, where they have sewer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions than a vast congregation affords, Have they not many times, after have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forecast the particulars of their state in their mind, kneeled down with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to make such or such confessions, petitions, thankesgiveings, or intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which, being more affected withsome other particulars, they have cleare omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. If it be said, notwithstanding these omissions, God was privy to those inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; will accept themfor express pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: I return, so he was to the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the mind, in all which was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest, and if expression was necessary in one, it was in the other; especially,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40528:50"/> being a way is obvious which might comprehend (more neerly) all. And, which is more considerable, secondly, though God be privy to our intentions, man is not; and so they who should have joyned with the speaker in prayer, that is all ingaged in the prayer, but himself, are at a losse.</p>
                     <p>Further as in this kind such omissions are inevitable, so is there great danger of more positive michief. A man though pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed actually with the fear of God, may deliver on a sudden a proposition, which he could oftentimes wish recalled, as not fully foreseeing its consequence, when yet in the uprightness of his heart he spoke it. What miscarriages there have been of this nature frequent, I will not mention, though at hand: but sure, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to justifie that Twelfth Canon of the Council of <hi>Milevis,</hi> forbidding a more cautious practice than this, <hi>Ne fortè aliquod contra fidem, vel per ignorantiam, vel per minus studium sit compositum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This as to the matter of such prayer, and in the next place as to words: though some men are more happy in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary language than other, yet ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neraly
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40528:50"/> the first expressions which offer themselves (and which in this case most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a man must take) are not the fittest, properest and most pregnant. Things spoken on the sudden are commonly more rawly, imperfectly and confused<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exprest, which consequently must needs be as indistinctly apprehended by the auditory. Now certainely care ought to be taken that our <hi>sacrifices</hi> should be, as neer as can be, <hi>without ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish</hi> even in these outer parts.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, as to the Consent of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, which any prayer, offered in publick, ought to have to make it their common act, I have already said, that it is most necessary men judge before they consent (and truly, too commonly, where conceived prayer is used in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, most people are more employed in judging than in praying) now suppose after judgment past in the breasts of the hearers, many of them shall not think fit to consent to such a confessory, peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary or Eucharisticall passage, what then is become of the Common or Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick prayer? Where is the agreement and conspireing votes of the faithfull,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40528:51"/> necessary to render it more effectuall? And yet this seems to be required by our Lord, <hi>Math: XVIII,</hi> 19. Here then are three or four considerable, yet undeniable, inconveniencies attending the prayer thus uttered.</p>
                     <p>2. As to the Performer or him who is the mouth of the rest: Though we admit him to be a person of happy gifts, of a vast comprehension, ready thought and memory, and as ready speech, yet no man being the same at all times, and he being to represent to God not onely his own state and wants (which his own heart possibly would more facilly sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest) but the peoples too; First, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, memory and invention must needs oftentimes be more on the rack, than they would be in the use of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, well-accomplisht, and known Form, to which in every point his whole soul might attend and consent without such distraction, or dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ease. And, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, When he shall apprehend any thing to be by him too unadvisedly, in. sufficiently, or blunderingly exprest, if he have any grain of Modesty in him, he cannot but be concern'd and disturbed:
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40528:51"/> and the uneasiness of this may be much greater than that of the former case, and so more considerably withdraw his heart from due attention, if not sometimes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most confound him in some part or pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of his Prayer. Here then is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Distraction attending the publick Performer in this kind of Prayer.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, in regard of the Auditory it has certainly these inconveniencies.</p>
                     <p>First, The Devotion of the whole Congregation is tyed not onely to the measure of the Ministers gifts and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which in many are but mean or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, but also to all the infelicities of his present temper, and the disorders of his heart. There is certainly much more reason to complain of <hi>stinting the spirit,</hi> if we respect the hearts of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in this case than under well compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Forms. Admit a man to be but a mean Master of speech, memory and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, the Congregation, whose pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers can be no better than he can on the sudden pour out, is in a miserable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Admit him to be never so great an Oratour, yet no man hath at all times the same presence of mind and readiness
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40528:52"/> of utterance. Now it would be a deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable case, that five or six hundred mens devotions should depend onely on ones, and be subject to be dampt or confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his distempers; of which even good men are subject to various. 1. To dulness or grosser indisposition of body, and so of mind. 2. To incogitancy and wandrings. No man so intirely devout, as that he can alwayes set bounds to his thoughts, nor therefore to his expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. 3. To incumbrances and distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from without. The Holiest men are many times more affected with worldly concernments and events than becomes them: and no man of reason can think it a tolerable evil, that the devotions of a multitude should be disordered by the distractions of a single person. Lastly, I have already insinuated the mischief, which mustredound to the Congregation in publick conceived prayers, by reason of unavoidable omissions, or the defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies of memory &amp; consideration, if of no other faculty. Let the incommodities arising from these and other like so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently emergent cases be put together, &amp; the summe will be very considerable.</p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:40528:52"/>
                     <p>Secondly, conceived prayers are much more difficult to all mixt Auditories, than are known and common Forms. It is a very hard thing to speak so plainly, as to make half the common people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, especially when there is no opportunity of interlocutory helps, and a man must take the words, which first offer. The language of Universities and Cities, and of men of liberal education, amongst whom men, that may be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed qualified for this performance, have or should have been bred, is much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from that of the Vulgar. A multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of neater words insensibly insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate themselves, and by use become fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar and natural to us, which though they are plain to men of education, are not so to the illiterate. Again, what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth singularity of words do men gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to this conceived way, affect? I list not to expose any. Upon these and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps many other accounts (already touched) it is evident such prayers are very difficult, and as they who <hi>occupy the room of the unlearned,</hi> can seldome, for want of having understood what was said, say <hi>Amen</hi> to half, so by reason of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40528:53"/> obscurity or confusion more learn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d persons are sometimes in no better a plight.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly the devotion of the Hearers, yea even of the most judicious is put to frequent losses, by reason of the mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> novelty of many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions and things. As before said, after I have heard I must iudge be fore I can consent: and if by reason of novelty, affectation of expression, ambiguity, indigestedness, or any such rub in my way, I cannot readily judge, but hesitate and deliberate touching this or that passage, in the meane time he who prayes is gone on, and now upon a new subject, and I evidently left behind and at l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>sse, and miserably perhaps confounded before my devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can close in again: and no sooner it may be well fixt, but again lead into the same inconveniency and Maze.</p>
                     <p>I professe I have not plaid the sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in any of these charges: I judge in my conscience all men who understand things, and are sober and unprejudicate, must needs acknowledge the truth of what I have said; and it is not impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40528:53"/> but that I might have added much more on this Subject.</p>
                     <p>But it is time now to pass to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration<note place="margin">Sect. 8</note> of common, known, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed Forms. And first as to their Conveniencies.</p>
                     <p>1. They are more mature and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive, than are, or can be, any extemporaneous effusions: and that both as to matter and words. They are made upon consideration and study, and not with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ut invokeing the assistance of the Holy Ghost. They are afterwards scannd and examind by their authours. They then pass many other learned mens judgments, and perhaps corrections; by all which they are fitted not onely to the publick ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="5 letters">
                           <desc>•••••</desc>
                        </gap>ties and condition of the people, as to the matter contained in them, but to such facility and naturall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of speech as may comply with all mens understanding, and withall, to such gravity and reverence, as is due to the divine worship.</p>
                     <p>2 Though it should be supposed, that by reason of that temper, in our people generally, which the Holy Ghost objects to the Hebrews (<hi>Chap:</hi> V <hi>ver.</hi> 11, 12)
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40528:54"/> that even forms themselves, when new, are not so well understood by them as they should be, yet Common formes by being common become generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood. And this is a matter of very great moment: For it is all one in effect whether I pray in an <hi>unknowne tongue,</hi> or in words of a tongue which I know, but do not understand these particular words of it; <hi>still my understanding is unfruitfull,</hi> and my devotion confused, and the benefit of such prayer little or none at all. Now this our daily experience teacheth as, that there are very few that desire to be serious in their prayers, who are not easily brought to pray <hi>with understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> by forms, and so with distinct edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. We may note therefore that our Lord Jesus thus taught his disciples to pray: for he saith, not only, <hi>After this manner pray ye</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>) <hi>Thus pray ye,</hi> each of which words bears an Emphasis with advantage to this cause, though some have so wrested them as to inferre thence the Lords prayer to be onely a pattern for our imitation) but, <hi>when ye pray, say our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
                        <pb n="71" facs="tcp:40528:54"/> &amp;c. which words as expressly injoin the use of this form as any words can command any thing, as hath been shewn by a learned man in an Exercitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that purpose. And indeed had not our Lord taught to pray by a form, he had not taught a way of prayer, of which all his followers had been capable. Forthough some, who have nimble natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts may, by a little instruction and practice, be brought to conceive a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as they speak (but many times ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in affected (that I say not canting) language than intelligible) such an unar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial education, as before described, sufficing to excite and help a pregnant fancy, yet those, who have slower con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and mean memories, are very difficultly, and not but in a long time, if at all, brought hereto. Yea I have known some men singularly pious, learned and judicious, from whom I have seen many excellent Prayers written, as being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by them upon meditation and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, who yet were never able to pray with any tolerable readiness in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived way. And I have heard as much of the famous T. C. of whom more anon;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40528:55"/> but perhaps that way was scarce known in his dayes. Wherefore <hi>I</hi> may reckon it as a <hi>Third</hi> advantage of Prayer by Form, that it helps all mens infirmities. God forbid the world should ever be brought to that pass (as some would have had it) that none must ever offer up a prayer of their own to God, but such who are able to do it by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended gift. Now there is no person of whatsoever condition, sex, or almost age, if we suppose them to have any exercise of reason, but may be able to pray in this way, and that allowing them sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and understanding of what they say, as acceptably to God, as the ablest and most exercised Christian. By this means doth God in a manner, <hi>out of the mouths of babes and sucklings</hi> receive glory, and a sweet savour.</p>
                     <p>A fourth advantage of prayer by form is, that it governs and restraines some mens extravagant phansies and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes as well as expressions. This was noted by <hi>Mr. Calvin,</hi> as his third rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son<note place="margin">In E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist. ad.

                     <p>Lastly, it cannot but be a secret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort to a Christian mans Soul who useth the approved and prescribed Forms, that in the use of them he strictly maintains, &amp; perhaps injoyes &amp; tasts, the swee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40528:56"/> of the faithfull joining with him, and it may be at that very instant, in the same prayers. And it must needs be some satisfaction to any meek and modest person, that his prayers are such, which have past the approbation of a Church truly Catholick and Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. I would indeed that all men should see with their own eyes; but some have not the best sight, and by whom can such be better guided, and in whose sentence more satisfactorily acquiesce, than by such a Church, and in her reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution? Besides, such a concurrent judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth no wise preclude or infringe my own, but rather addes to me fuller persuasion and content. And certainly, if there be any truth in that promise of our saviour, <hi>that where two of you shall agree on earth touching any thing that they s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>all ask, it shall be done for them in heaven,</hi> so vast a consent of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in prayer must needs adde much more to the effectualness thereof, than if all these congregations varied from the other &amp; each of these the next time from it self, as lesse or more it would be in the conceived way. These are
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40528:56"/> many, but I dare not say all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of prayer by approved and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed forms.</p>
                     <p>Now to speak as impartially touching<note place="margin">Sect. 9.</note> its inconveniencies: and I promise not to spare one, that I have either heard of, or can imagin.</p>
                     <p>First, it may seem justly said, that sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Forms, which are allwayes the same, cannot be so close and pertinent to our particular wants and conditions, both spiritual and outward, as those which are in a manner dictated by an heart viewing those concerns. And our wants or estates varying, so ought our prayers. Now too much generality cannot but be a fault, inasmuch as things generally considered and attended unto more slightily affect.</p>
                     <p>Besides that, secondly, Even use and frequency, as some say (and pretend their experience for their saying so) breeds dullness and incogitance. The lips and tongue can go without the heart, and so the heart often overruns them, scarce many times giveing them the meeting at the <hi>Amen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly it is ordinarily alledged, or
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40528:57"/> has been at least (though retorted even by Dr. <hi>Freston</hi> against the very concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved way in publick) that Forms of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er do stint the spirit, too narrowly bound <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ens affections, and as it were cramp their devotions; which have more liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to take their free course and utmost flig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> words.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, Forms seem more servile and mean: they savour more of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Paedagogy than of the Evangelical spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: they are as milk fit for the weaker and ruder sort. They became the Church in its Childhood, and may become par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular persons while they are yet babes in Christ; but neither are particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons alwayes to be children, nor the Church ever in Non-age: They become not therefore the present Age of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, much less of the Reformation. This is the summe of the incommodities of Forms, which I am able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce.</p>
                     <p>If any deem me to have been too spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in this behalf, I profess it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause upon serious and long thought, more materials did not occur: and if any
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40528:57"/> person will be pleased to add to them, I hereby bind my self, when such inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations come to my knowledge, to make a due answer to such new inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or else ingenuously to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that I am not able to see, but that such inconveniencies are irremedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and intolerable.</p>
                     <p>And thus now both kinds of prayer<note place="margin">Sect. 10.</note> lye before us with their respective ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages and inconveniencies. Now to make a true judgment upon the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the whole, comparing both, we will say, That which soever kind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides its own conveniencies, is capable of most of the conveniencies of the other, and hath least inconveniencies either of its own, or from the addition of so much of the other as it partakes of, is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be preferr'd. This rule is so reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, that I may presume it will not be excepted against. But such <hi>I</hi> say is Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er by allowed or prescribed Forms, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in publick, and perhaps by arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Forms (though variable) most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in private: and this will be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by view of the particulars already laid down.</p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:40528:58"/>
                     <p>First, its own conveniencies are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted. 1. Maturity, comprehensive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and more exactness. 2. Intelligible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or being more accommodate to the peoples or all mens understanding. 3. Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness and succouring the infirmities of the weakest. 4. Bounding extravagant designs and phansies, restraining idle suits. 5. The comfort which redounds from the sense of the communion of Saints maintained herein, the satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from our prayers being approved by so competent a Judge as the Church: together with the greater effectualness thereof, in all likelyhood, as being offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with so general consent.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Prayer by Forms, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by allowed and prescribed Forms, is capable of all the real advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of conceived prayer in publick. <hi>I</hi> said of all its real advantages: for it is no prevarication to say, all its reputed advantages are not real▪ As namely. 1. The <hi>newness</hi> of a Prayer in general is no advantage of it at all, nor is it any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice on the other side to a Prayer, that it is known or old. Can any man say, he is less able to pray with due af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40528:58"/> because he knows what petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or parts of prayer the Minister will come to next, or understands all he will say: Rather in all likelyhood, knowledge in this case should prepare the heart to a meet temper. Those persons whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty onely, or chiefly, brings to their prayers, are certainly men of very aiery and fantastical devotion (let the Reader pardon the seeiming contradiction in the terms) The onely case, as far as <hi>I</hi> can see, wherein it is a commendation to a prayer that it is new, is, when there is something new in the condition of the Supplicant, to which it is accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date. Now it is well known, upon new occasions our Church frames new Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers suitable thereto: and Christ himself, who had the spirit without measure, doubted not in the same case to use three times the same words. But thus taken, the newness of prayer resolves it self into the particularity of it, which was reckoned as a second advantage of conceived prayer. And touching this <hi>I</hi> say, forasmuch as publick prayers must be supposed to be offered up by every particular person in the Congregation,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40528:59"/> whose conditions in particulars differ, but agree for the main onely in their generall nature, therefore all publick prayers ought to be conceived in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall terms; otherwise they will not fitt all the particular persons who are to joyne therein. It is therefore no fault of the Confession in the begining of our Liturgy, that it is general: Every man were thereby in some degree a liar, if he should accuse himselfe of those sins, whereof yet another man ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse himselfe. In publick prayers, it must be a mans particular reflexions on his own condition, while he offers up the general forms, that must make them particular. Thus he that reflects on the peculiar errours of his wayes, on his omissions and commissions, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats the generall confession, makes the confession as particular to himself, as any publick confession of sin ought to be. And beyond this, particularity in publick prayers, as is evident, would be no virtue at all. Nay, any conceived prayers what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, can no otherwise than thus become particular to a mixt auditory. And as to the 3▪ advantage of conceived prayer, that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40528:59"/> it is more apt to affect, I say, that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that this is not true as to all and it may be as to very few besides the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, such devout and particular use and application of publick forms, as just now spoken of, will make them as apt to affect as any publick conceived p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: for that conceived prayers are forms to all but him, who makes them, The same is to be said as to the 4th and last advantage of conceived prayer, that it is more apt to keep men attentive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

If by spirit, we mean the spirit of the auditours, it being tied to words still, and those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary too, is as much or more stinted than in the other way. If we mean the spirit of the speaker, that possibly is under some distraction; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that may be called restraint, we leave to consideration. However this
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40528:61"/> plea can onely be made for such prayer in secret, between God and our Souls, which comes not within our present compasse, and which no man can inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit us: or if he do, 'tis frivolously done, in as much as we can still injoy our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty herein, both without his leave and knowledge.</p>
                     <p>There Remains onely the last impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation against prayer by form to be weighed, that it is servile and mean, below the dignity and more liberall attainments of the Gospell state: Now this is a pretence grounded chiefly upon point of honour, and importing not so much any incommodity, as something inglorious. But be it what it will, we wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>l consider it in its utmost force. Will then any man pretend that the <hi>Glorious liberty of the Sons of God,▪</hi> amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Rom: VIII. 15.</note> things, imports a free habit of speech? We have indeed, through the bloud of <hi>Jesus, received the spirit of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>option, whereby we cry Abba Father:</hi> that<note place="margin">Hebr: X 19.</note> is, we have, through the same bloud, <hi>boldnesse to enter into the holiest.</hi> In o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther terms, we have free accesse unto God as a father, according to our needs.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40528:62"/> But does this inferr any internall gift or personal ability of utterance, so much as an exteriour priviledg, by Gods great vouchsafement conferred on us? And is it not very certain too this liberty may be abused? Besides, can we, by force of this dignation, pretend to any such plerophory of the spirit, that all the petitions we shall make, shall, by vertue thereof, be acceptable, fit, and such as become us? Have we no need of thought, and forming our requests? And if we have, where is the dishonour in acknowledging and practiceing it? Or can it, all being considered that has been said, be pleaded by any, that prayer in the conceived way is generally most accomplisht and excellent? And if it must be acknowledged, both as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and form, more imperfect, is it then any honor to pray in a more imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect sort? Will it credit the Gospell, that men upon presumption of priviledges under it, present God with more raw &amp; inconsiderate addresses?</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole then, haveing shewn how all the reall inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies of prayer by form may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40528:62"/> and haveing removed such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, which are by prejudice and mistake affixt to it, its own advantages being besides so great, and it selfe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of all the true advantages so much magnified in conceived prayer, I must needs give it, especially in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, every way the preference.</p>
                     <p>Haveing thus made good the assertion touch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ng prayer by known and prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed forms, to give <hi>good measure, pressed down, and even running over, I</hi> might here more particularly insist, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived prayer neither has, nor in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way can possibly have the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of due forms and that indeed, neither in publick nor private. I will not deny but supposeing a liberal utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, it may in private more comply with a large heart: and it may be good, in some case, in private to allow great affections their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ent, yet all waies with sobriety and humility. But this I do avow, that such prayer can never be so mature and comprehensive; so easy to all men, whether to practice themselves, or understand in others; and that in stead of governing it must needs give way to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40528:63"/> thoughts, phansies, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding all this, some haply may urge their own experience, and<note place="margin">Sect: 11</note> plead, that feeling inwardly its efficacy and excellency, they ought not to suffer themselves to be beaten out of it. And to make this argument as plausible as I can, to give it all the strength which upon full consideration I am able to see it is capable of, We will say, there is such a thing as a kind of spirituall sense or tast. And the royall prophet hath warranted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he expression, when he saith (<hi>Ps. XXXIV. 8.) O tast and see that the Lord is good:</hi> now of this it may be said, as of common taste (<hi>non est dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandum</hi>) a man is not to be disputed out of it. And supposeing that any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hereby have perceived a remarkable advantage of conceived prayer, above prayer by form, he ought to suffer no discourses whatsoever to perswade him out of this his spiritual sense.</p>
                     <p>I answer hereto, according to what I have above allowed, who goes about it? But this advantage still is private, and though we should admitt this plea
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40528:63"/> of such spiritual sensation to be a sober one, yet it can be in reason prest no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than for mens private use of such sort of prayer, which they feel most effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious to move them, and every way <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> them most excellent. For this can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be proved the publick sense, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as there are so many th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>usands who reclaim and protest otherwise, that they are not onely sensible, but as they think able to demonstrate to others, as I conceive it hath been in this Discourse already done, that there is much more advantage in knowne and stated Forms.</p>
                     <p>But let us a little more intimately consider this pretence. It resolves into nothing else but this, that the soul is conscious to its self of its own acts, &amp; the impressions made upon itself▪ Such &amp; such offices or performances may move more ardent affections, and the mind moved therewith cannot but feel them, and perceive that it doth feel them: and then all the reason or discourse in the world cannot, nor ought to perswade us, that we do not feel, what we do feel and are conscious of. Now I say, still of this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40528:64"/> sense, if it be not Enthusiastical or Fantastick, a rational account is to be given. For as in the outward senses, there is no real sensation, except there be an object to move them; so in this spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual sense, there can be no real percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of such excellency, except there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally be such excellency: and that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency if we are not able to make out ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally to our selves and others, it is imagination or humour, which we mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staking call spiritual sense. Upon as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular examination of the case as we could make, we have found prayer by Form to have all the real advantages in publick above conceived prayer. And the truth is (seeing it must be spoken out) if conceived prayer in publick be any more efficacious, or apt to move any Hearers than prayer by due Forms, it is onely by reason of Novelty; prejudice or Custome. How far those affections are to be valued that meer Novelty rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, we have already spoken. And as to the other points, it must be confessed, that many honest minds lye under a great prejudice against Forms by reason of their Education in Factious Times,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40528:64"/> and perhaps (in part) under Factious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who have instilled into them their own Opinions, and inured them to a kind of Enthusiastick Worship of God. These persons have never been used to pray affectionately in any but new and conceived prayers, and therefore they think (as before intimated) there is no praying affectionately otherwise. But would these good men honestly lay aside their prejudice, would they fairly &amp; with understanding read and consider our Church-Liturgy, would they come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to with prepared, and devout souls, would they thus make tryal of it a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, lifting up <hi>their pure minds</hi> to God in the use of it, they would soon find, even under it, that tenderness of heart and warmth of affection, which they have experienced in the other way, and which, without vanity or dissimulation, we profess to all the World, for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, we do find under it as often generally, as with due attention and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riousness of mind we are conversant in the use of it. They would find also, by its comprehending more universally all their wants, and the wants of the whole
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40528:65"/>
                        <hi>Israel</hi> of God, the great advantage to be on this side; and that there is no such spiritual sense against us in this case, as is pretended. And thus I have endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in all calmness, candour and sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and with the greatest reason and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that I could use, to satisfie this question, as to the real intrinsick merit of the Cause.</p>

                     <p>And in answer to this Enquiry, I say summarily, it cannot reasonably be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, (1.) That some passages in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Liturgy were Forms used in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Times of the Apostles, if not by the Apostles themselves. (2) That if some of the Apostles themselves did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile Liturgies, yet soon after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles dayes there were Liturgies compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, used, and generally injoyned by the Bishops of the more Eminent Churches. (3) That it is certain that ever since the beginning of the Fourth Century till the Reformation, there have been general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no other prayers but known and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Forms, publickly used by allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the Catholick Church. And Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, none other publickly, since the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40528:66"/> by allowance in our Church.</p>
                     <p>For making good the first Assertion, I will produce Three or Four instances. That passage <hi>Sursum corda,</hi> Lift up your hearts, St. <hi>Austin</hi> saith to be <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba ab ipsorum Apostolorum temporibus pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tita,</hi> words derived from the time of the very Apostles, as well as used in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy of the Church in his dayes. And we find them expresly, with the answer to them, We lift them up unto the Lord, <hi>Habemus ad Dominum</hi> in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy ascribed to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little addition in that ascribed to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little addition in that ascribed to St. <hi>James,</hi> of both which more anon.

And Lastly, what prevaileth most is the suffrage of the Father sin the sixth General Council, begun at <hi>Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> but denominated from <hi>Trullo</hi> where it was finished, who avow in defence of their Thirty second Canon, or the rite which they thereby enact, that S. <hi>James the brother of our Lord, according to the flesh—in an holy Office or ritual delivered to them (<gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>e of mixing water with the wine were really a Tradition of St. <hi>James</hi>'s or no, it mattereth not to my purpose: It is not easily supposeable, that Two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred twenty seven Fathers (for so many there were in that Council) should urge an authority of dubious repute, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a Book to be then received, which was not received. And this is evidence sufficient to prove, that in the Ancient Church, which was nearer the Apostles times, and had more advantage to search the truth, it was no wise doubted but
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40528:71"/> some of the Apostles were Authours to the Church of a publick stated Form of Worship (which is all I contend for) however those Forms are not come sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere to us. This as to the Liturgy ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to St. <hi>James.</hi> There are some autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities which I could produce for that of St. <hi>Marks,</hi> and the other of St. <hi>Peters,</hi> indefinitely, that those Holy men were reputed to have left Liturgies to their Churches, I do not say these intirely but in part, for I avow these abominably cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt: but what I have said is enough to my design in the assertion I have laid down.</p>
                     <p>Now if any one should judge the first part thereof, that some of the Apostles did deliver the Grounds of a Liturgy to the Church, scarce evident, yet thus much is beyond controversie, that Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies under these names (particularly that attributed to St. <hi>James</hi>) were extant in the times alledged, and that is the first proof which I produce for the later part of that my second Assertion, That soon after the Apostles dayes, there were Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies compiled, used, and generally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined by the Bishops of the more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40528:71"/> Churches. As to the compiling and use of Liturgies, it is plain that one of these, as to the ground of it, could not be of later date than the Third cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, if of so late. And as to the injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Liturgies, there cannot be clearer evidence demanded, than express Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of Councils or Syn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <q>We think fit there be observed one order of praying and singing throughtout all <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Galicia,</hi> one form in celebrateing the solemnities of the Eucharist, one form in the Evensong &amp;c. because we are all of one faith and Kingdome.</q>
                     </p>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40528:74"/> &amp; Popish superstitions now came in apace on the Church, &amp; it is not much to be heeded what the councils in such dayes enacted. Now though all men know the pretended universal Bishop had not yet so easily gotten the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal power, as to overaw all Councils and synods, yet on this suggestion, <hi>I</hi> will give my reader no more exercise for patience on this subject; these things ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, I presume, both abundantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved my second assertion, and made a fair way for the <hi>third.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which being negative, the proof indeed would rather lye on the other side (possession being, as they say, a good title, till a better is made out) The Church were to be produced which in some time, betwixt the daies from whence we have dated Liturgies &amp; the reformation at <hi>Geneva,</hi> did allow arbitrary or conceived prayers. But this indeed being not to be done, we will give it as good a proof as the case will admitt, and such, the foundation of which we have already laid. We will then suppose (&amp; the supposition will be deemed violent by none, who have read
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40528:74"/> any thing, and observed the severity of those ages in points of Ecclesiastical or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and discipline) that in former daies men did not, as they do now in our country, make lawes and never keep them. If Ecclesiastical order was once enacted, it was strictly observed: excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications then were dreadfull, and pennances heavy. So that haveing found the observation of Liturgies so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly decreed, and these decrees so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently all over the Church iterated and enforced, in every particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince whither the Church had spread it selfe, we cannot think the allowed practice of the Catholick Church was contrary to its direct and so often repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted lawes. On the otherside we may conclude the censures of the Church to have been brisk &amp; severe against all who affected innovation in this case, and in any the least regard made attempts thereto.</p>
                     <p>I remember not at present, in my small reading to have met with any, who varied from the publick received or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Forms of Worship, but such who being themselves infected with
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40528:75"/> some Haeresie or other, had a mind to spread their contagion, and used this as the least suspicious, and most effectual course of instilling its poison into the people.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40528:83"/> and this Order of the Communion, there were several publick occasions which required to be particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in the publick prayers, for these there were particular collects fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and used in the end of the Litany. Thus I find by Archbishop <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Articles of Visitation in the 2. of King <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. <q>Whether <hi>the Curates</hi> in their Common-prayers, use not the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects made for the King, and make not special mention of His Majesties name therein, <hi>Art.</hi> 4.

                     <p>But soon after came forth a riper and more perfect birth: for on <hi>Sept.</hi> 1. the King commended to those godly Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and other learned Divines, whom he had before employed in the <hi>Order of</hi> the <hi>Communion,</hi> the framing of a <hi>publick Liturgy,</hi> or <hi>Order of Morning and Evening prayer, and of ministring the Sacraments

                     <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> injunctions, as to this<note place="margin">Anno 1559.</note> point, are much to the same purpose with King <hi>Edwards;</hi> witness the 5th, the 18th &amp;c.

                        <hi>praise God for them,</hi> and to pray for <hi>themselves,</hi> that they <hi>may have grace to direct their lives after their good examples, and be partakers with them of the glorious resurrection in the life everlasting.</hi> And this, amongst the other points, is injoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as before in King <hi>Edwards</hi> injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) to be <q>obse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The injunction of it was the same as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, onely the penalties somewhat more particular and severe, 1 <hi>Eliz. cap. 2. &amp; 23. Eliz. cap.</hi> 1.</p>
                     <p>These things were onely reinforced (some Explanations of the Liturgy being made by his Majesties Commission) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der King <hi>James,</hi> by his Proclamation of <hi>Mar.</hi> 5. in the first Year of his Reign of <hi>England,</hi> and by the Canons of 1603. As
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40528:85"/> to the state of things under our late martyred and blessed Soveraign King <hi>Charles</hi> the first, and the continuance of such order not onely in our own Church, but promoting it in the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> to whom our Liturgy, with such due alterations as accommodated it more to the approbation of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was sent and prescribed, things are so fresh in most mens memories, or so common in all our little Historians, that nothing need to be said. All that can be pretended by way of objection against what I have spoken, touching the allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of our Church, must be grounded upon the 55. Canon, which will come under consideration in the following Section. In the mean while, I hope I have spoken particularly, and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stratively enough (as the case will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit) touching the practice of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church in this behalf.</p>
                     <p>Now as to the <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>Progress</hi> of <hi>conceived prayer</hi> in publick, I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,<note place="margin">

                        </note> that in the Miraculous age of the Church, there were <hi>inspired</hi> prayers, and that this is the true Scripture notion of prayer by <hi>Gift.</hi> I have also cited, in
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40528:86"/> the Front of this Discourse, a passage out of St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> undeniably to the same effect. But as to that notion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conceived prayer has been of late years practised, and is still contended for, I do say, the <hi>Thing</hi> is in a manner as new as the <hi>Name,</hi> and neither of them much above one 100 years old. By <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived prayer,</hi> I here mean, a <hi>course</hi> of fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming publick <hi>vocal prayer</hi> ever <hi>anew,</hi> &amp; as it is spoken, according to a mans present &amp; <hi>arbitrary conceptions,</hi> in which he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to be assisted by the <hi>spirit</hi> of God. And thus taken, as far as upon search made I can find, both the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Thing</hi> appeared first in the World at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi> and that some time after <hi>Calvin</hi>'s return thither, as near as I can conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, about the Year 1550; Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> himself being the first man, whom I can discover to have used <hi>publickly,</hi> either any new form of prayer of his own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, varied arbitrarily by himself, or any such course of praying as now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed: but to give that worthy (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in some things unhappy) man his due, very modestly and soberly.

                        <q>As in the beginning of his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, this our Doctour alwayes uses a Form of prayer, which we also have caused here to be set down, that the whole way of his teaching might be known; so is he wont to close each Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture commonly with a new prayer, according as by the spirit of the Lord it is given to him <hi>ex tempore</hi> to frame the same, and accommodate it to the subject matter of the Lecture.</q> This preface bears date in the Year 1557, and <hi>Calvin</hi>'s prelections on the <hi>Minor</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, being the first of all his prelecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:40528:87"/> now extant (at least amongst his <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Works, others are uncertain) and this his practice beginning with his prelecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it is plain I have reckoned favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, when I cast it into the Year 1550, or thereabouts. Behold then here the first instance of this kind of publick prayer in the Christian Church, since the cessation of Miracles. And it would seem hereby, that the name <hi>Extemporary prayer</hi> was more ancient than <hi>conceived.</hi> But how far distant this practice of <hi>Calvins</hi> was from▪ that of late and present dayes amongst us, shall appear by the view of <hi>Calvins</hi> own Forms.

                        </q> This in our dayes would be looked upon as a strangely short prayer before Sermon: but such was the modesty of this man, when he brought in first into the Church a Form
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40528:87"/> of his own. His Extemporary prayers (as those commonly use to be longer than Forms) did something exceed this, and were for the most part of five or six lines, seldome or never exceeding nine or ten; as any may see who list to consult his praelections on <hi>Jeremy, Ezekiel, Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> and the <hi>minor</hi> prophets. If any should object this to have been his practice on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his Lectures, but that surely at his Sermons he used more liberally to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise this his gift, though I find little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt his Lectures and his Sermons, but onely that perhaps they were delivered most of them in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Tongue and he has pleased to give them a diverse na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <q>All these things let us ask of him, as our supreme Master and Lord Jesus Christ has taught us to pray unto him in these words, <hi>Our Father.</hi>
                        </q> It is plain, that this is also rather a summary Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation directing what to pray for, and moving the people to ask all these things in the words of our Lords prayer, than any true formal prayer, such as the usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al conceived ones of our dayes: so that though by the forementioned interserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, alwayes varied, and those short Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary prayers before spoken of, he gave the first instance of what we call <hi>conceived prayer,</hi> yet this was, according to the character already given, with great modesty and sobriety, not ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at the rate that our people do, who would seem by the length of their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to have received <hi>the spirit without measure,</hi> but that generally the lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table stuff they vent, shews they mistake the abortions of their own fancies for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine suggestions. I do not say, but that there are some persons who use this kind of prayer with good <hi>decorum</hi> and great grace, and possibly to good pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40528:90"/> advantage: but we see how small the beginnings hereof, at least in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick were; of how late age, and with what tenderness a famous Doctour, a man of as eminent parts, industry, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of mind, as many ages have shewn, and withal the Father and Founder of that party who cry up this way, adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured at an Ejaculation or two at a time therein, when our common people, nay some even children in a manner, dayly challenge an arbitrary &amp; unlimited right thereto, and pretend themselves in the constant exercise hereof to be moved and enabled by the Holy Ghost.</p>
                     <p>As to <hi>Calvin</hi>'s part I shall onely add, that he was so far from admitting this unlimited gift of prayer, that in extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary cases of the calamities of the <hi>Genevan</hi> Church, he composed, used and prescribed particular Forms (<hi>quibus reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui ministri in urbe &amp; agro uterentur</hi>) for <q>the Ministers to use both in City and Countrey, which are extant to this day.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now that I have not impleaded this way of more novelty, than it is really chargeable with, I shall produce the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:40528:90"/> of a very pious and learned man, and him sufficiently a friend thereto, Dr. <hi>Preston</hi> by name, whom, since my<note place="margin">Saints daily Exerc. Ser▪ 3.</note> fixing this practice where I have done, I find to acknowledge all in a manner which I have contended for, touching the primitive and constant use of Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies. <hi>In the Church,</hi> saith he, <hi>at all times, both in the primitive times, and all along to the beginning of the Reformed times, to</hi> Luther <hi>and</hi> Calvin▪<hi>s time, still in all times the Church had set forms they used, and</hi> I <hi>know no objection against it of weight.</hi> Touching <hi>Luther</hi> I shall say more anon. As to <hi>Calvin,</hi> I have already made it evident, he was far from laying aside all Forms, and out of the very Forms, which to this day they have in that very Church, which most follows his Rules, it is notorious, I might speak much more. Onely this I note here, that the use of set Forms in the Church, is not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to have received any disturbance, till since the Reformation by these two eminent persons: and yet that such use, as such, could not be any Popish corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption (as the clamours of some pretend) which needed Reformation, seeing it is
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:40528:91"/> owned to have been continued <hi>all along,</hi> and even <hi>in the primitive times.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To bring conceived prayer nearer home; I need not speak how apt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is to follow Great and New Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, especially in points which give men advantages to display their own admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red excellencies.

But besides this unhappy propensity, there were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral occurrences, which at first drew many of our Countrey men into love with and afterwards made the way fair for, the publick introducing of this practice. It is not to be denied, but there were some few too much enclined to <hi>Zwingli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anism,</hi> who quarrelled the Liturgie in the dayes of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. The dreadful storm under Queen <hi>Mary</hi> drove these, amongst many better and more sober persons of our Nation into a voluntary Exile, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in <hi>Germany,</hi> partly amongst the <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers</hi> &amp;c. The place which gave them most encouraging reception was <hi>Frankford;</hi>
                        <pb n="145" facs="tcp:40528:91"/> and hither therefore the greatest num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber flocked. In the head of these ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared <hi>Whittingham, Goodman, Williams, &amp;c.</hi> persons of the character before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated, and ill affected to our Liturgy, though contented enough to have one of their own. Here, whether by their own procuring underhand, or by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates imposing on them, <hi>I</hi> cannot say, they could not have the use of the <hi>French</hi> Church, but upon promise to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the <hi>French</hi> in Doctrine and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies. This these malecontents rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily accepted, strangely mangled the <hi>English</hi> Liturgy, left nothing but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession new modelled, the Psalms, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters and Creed, and, instead of the Hymns, had certain <hi>English</hi> Meeters, which being sung, the Preacher went up into the Pulpit, and improving much the pattern given at <hi>Geneva,</hi> made there a more solemn prayer before Sermon, than that of Mr. <hi>Calvins</hi> (which seemed but needful, inasmuch as our Litany <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>nd the whole body of the prayers were now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scarded) and after Sermon proceeded to a formal larger prayer for the whole state of the Church, especially the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
                        <pb n="146" facs="tcp:40528:92"/> Exiles, concluding wlth the Lords prayer, after the example of Mr. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin.</hi> To mend the matter, to this thus disfigured <hi>English</hi> Church comes <hi>Knox</hi> from <hi>Geneva,</hi> where he had some time taken sanctuary, having, by a seditious Pamphlet against the Government of <hi>Women,</hi> made both his own Countrey <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> in each of which a <hi>Mary</hi> then reigned, unsafe for him. He would have set up amongst these Exiles some other new Rules of his own; but finding his design unpracticable, he struck in for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the <hi>Genevan</hi> Order: which was carried a while, though not without great reluctancy of many, and some mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our English service.

                        </hi> (afterwards Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi>) with other able English Divines, in other Offices, and by this means, the Litany came into the Pulpit instead of the Preachers Prayers, and soon after most of the Service orderly, so that the face of the English Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion again appeared, though in Exile. But this lasted not long, for in Spring the Year ensuing, upon occasion of words past between Mr. <hi>Horn</hi> (then <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads</hi> successour) and one Mr. <hi>Ashley</hi> a popular Lay-man amongst them, the people take the power into their own hands, weary out their old Ministers, choose some new ones, manage all things by Officers appointed by themselves: in a word, Independency seems now to have entred into the world, and the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters they had, seemed rather to take unto themselves the liberty to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate the publick Worship to the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the people, than any regular pattern. By which advantage, arbitrary Prayers amognst them might easily, and ndoubtedly did grow apace, though I cannot instance in any particulars.</p>
                     <p>It is not to be wondred, if in the days
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40528:93"/> of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> these men returning, brought much of this unsettled humour with them, and inveigled others with the love of a Forreign (and therefore forsooth more admirable) Reformation, which pretended to be farther off from odious <hi>Rome,</hi> but in truth was onely more dissonant from the Rules of the Primitive Catholick Church, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both Ministry and People more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to pray and say whatever pleased them, than the sober English Form. But notwithstanding, the Order settled in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes, had not so uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Foundations, and the interval (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever dismal) betwixt his and Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign was not so long, but that the Liturgy and Lawes returned soon into their current: and though the Number of abused people, who were for some other Worship (but what, they did not well know) was by the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned means encreased; yet totally to wave the Liturgy, and bring instead thereof prayers of private composure, or <hi>conception</hi> (which was yet more rare) was not so feasib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e. The advantage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laid hold on was this. All Offices of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40528:93"/> Worship, before the Reformation, being performed in Latine, which the common people understood not, and it being not fit that whole Congregations, so much interessed in the publick Worship of God, should be excluded from any other share therein, than that of being idle spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators, or answering sometimes a blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold <hi>Amen</hi> to what they understood not, for remedy thereof, in the days of King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>VIII,</hi> when he had not yet faln out with the Pope, there had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised an English Exhortation to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, conteining the Heads of the (then) prayer for all Estates, which the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was to use before or in the beginning of his Sermon, as well to let them know whom they were to pray for, as to move them thereto. The Form is of some length, and may be seen at large in the fore cited Book of Mr. <hi>Ham: L'Estrange.</hi> The summe for some reasons I will set down. <q>After a laudable custome of our Holy Mother the Church, ye shall kneel down and pray for the Three Estates, the souls in Purgatory, our Holy Father the Pope, all Cardinals, Archbishops and Bishops▪ especially

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40528:94"/> Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes, being reinjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and was become now so innocent and conform to Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> injunction (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> II. 1, 2.) that those who liked not the Liturgy, did both like and use this before Sermon. The Chieftain of the Dissenters in those dayes was the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Mr. <hi>Thomas Cartwright</hi> who though he dreaded the Desk, yet stole oft into the Pulpit, first in some obscure Villages near <hi>Cambridge;</hi> afterwards he set up and read a Divinity Lecture (in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of later dayes, preached the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture) at <hi>Coventry.</hi> Most of his hearers having no more kindness for the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Church than himself, would not usually come into the Church before his Sermon began; and by this meanes being guilty of so great an irregularity, as both preacher to handle, and people to hear the Word, without any other solemn prayer, but that brief though most comprehensive one of our Lords, he was desired by some of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pals of his Followers, for their sakes who could not join in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prayer, to frame a prayer of his own before his Sermon: which he did, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:40528:95"/> the Exhortatory Form of bidding of prayer, with some addition of other Heads into a Form of prayer, which (I mean a Form of prayer of his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure) he used both privately and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly to his dying day. And I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber my self, soon after my first coming to the University, to have been inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a very ancient Minister of that perswasion, that Mr. <hi>T. C.</hi> however a man of great Learning &amp; parts, and an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Preacher, to his knowledg never did nor could <hi>pray by gift.</hi> We have thus seen in this great man, the first instance of a Prayer before Sermon (of the Preachers private composure) in <hi>England,</hi> though I believe none but that age, with which the World determines, will see the last. For this practice of Mr. <hi>Cartwrights</hi> no sooner appeared in the Nation, but it flew like <hi>lightning, from East to West,</hi> and he was imitated herein by Ministers of all sorts, as much as <hi>Calvin;</hi> &amp; though the Queen by her injunctions and Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, and by an express Proclamation (as I have heard) forbad it, (for after so comprehensive prayers as those of our Liturgy, if men would be serious

But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this orderly provision of mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, some not being able to manage them, and most thinking themselves above even thus much of a Form, very extravagant, immethodical, or else very lame and imperfect were most of the publick prayers: insomuch that some of the more sober men, of those very dayes, were really ashamed thereof; and amongst others, a learned and ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous person, drew together rules, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a systeme of precepts, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in complaisance to the language of the age, and to render somewhat of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:40528:97"/> sobriety more palatable to a fantastical world, he intituled, the <hi>Gift of prayer</hi> yet in that he teacheth therein this kind of prayer, as we use to do the more Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral Arts and Sciences, in that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to this office the principles of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, delivering heads for <hi>invention,</hi> and helps for language or <hi>elocution,</hi> this is in effect a fair confession, that what he called the Gift of prayer, was in his sense no better or no other, than what we have above resolved.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto the rise and progresse of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived prayer has been insisted on, in the notion wherein it was <hi>opposed</hi> to the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> as an Ordinance or office of the publick worship, and as the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of it was made a part of the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial</hi> function. As to the <hi>private</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of some what of this nature betwixt God and a mans own soul, in an <hi>ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory</hi> or <hi>occasional</hi> way, I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve some such thing to have been ever out of use amongst the faithfull, in any age of the Church, before or under the law, or since the Gospell. To breath out a petition, or so, under any pressing want, or upon any compassionable occasion is
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:40528:98"/> naturall: and had this been it, which some men meant in saying, that <hi>all men who have any work of grace upon their hearts are inabled to pray without a set form, and can expresse their wants one way or other,</hi> no man of sense would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deny it, but rather adde thereto. I will say, whether a man have a work of grace upon his heart, or whether he have not, let him ly under any calamity or want, or otherwise be considerably affected, and by the common faculties, which are naturall to all men, that have the use of reason and speech, he is able to expresse his wants or desires, one way or other, to God. The very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then mariners in <hi>Jonah,</hi> when they were likely to be cast away, prayed to God to save themselves and <hi>Jonah</hi> too. They were in their petitions very compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to him, and discreet as to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: yet I neither believe them to have been in that instant inspired with any gift of prayer, nor before that to have had any work of grace upon their hearts. Grace at the utmost, according as appeares by the story, was but then; if then, makeing its first attempt upon
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40528:98"/> them: nor can any man deny, but that common naturall abilities, admitting onely an ordinary concourse of God sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting us in the exercise of them, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for makeing such occasionall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses▪ I do not say, but that in some such occasionall suits there may be, and often is, more than nature. In those secret elapses, which the souls of the faithfull make daily and hourely to God, upon all varieties of occasions, there is undoubtedly much of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions and assistances of grace. The warmth of heart and good affection, nay it may be the very thought and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of praying at that instant, and on that occasion, proceed from the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God. But here the case is widely different: no such urging or passionate circumstances are supposed. Insuch cases, I say, there is the same naturall ability and (haply) prompt u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e to pray for help, as there is to <hi>perceive, desire</hi> and <hi>speak.</hi> And this being asserted by us there can be no controversy, remaining as to this point, were this the meaning of the gift of prayer: for what many times a man is able to do by strength of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40528:99"/> naturall faculties, he is certainly much more able to perform by them advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by grace.</p>
                     <p>But this is not the sense of conceived prayer, even in that notion, wherein it has been asserted to be the <hi>right</hi> of every <hi>private</hi> Christian. It is notorious, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by such a <hi>private Gift of prayer,</hi> they mean a being able to make a solemn, formall, continued speech to God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting a mans whole state, for the main, as to his spirituall and temporall concernments, and also interceding for others as occasion shall require; for the expressing of all which, they suppose the infused promptitude to supply the faithfull, with freeer and better terms, more naturall to their purpose, and more agreeable to the sentiments of their own hearts, than any they can otherwise be furnished with. Now this pretence I say is new: or if any, who are fond of the practice, will contend for the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of it, I believe they will not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem it any great credit to their cause, to have the eldest auth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For the instance given is plainly <hi>Meditation worded,</hi> the soliloquie of a strong faith, and ardent devotion, with God, in such language as great affections broke out into. And this his long retired life, and converse in deep thought with God, together with his study, and being exercised in Scripture and much preaching, had ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituated him for.

Yet it was not so adjudged in those circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, or that juncture of affaires.

The first, (which are far the fewest) are the honest old <hi>English</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, people soberly brought up in the bosome of the Church, truly serious and judicious in matters of Religion, who, though they have had the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness never to be quite out of the Church, yet are not therefore merely of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were born in it, but out of choice and conscience <hi>hold fast</hi> their Mothers <hi>sound Faith.</hi> These people well know how to address themselves to God in private, and in publick they would be fully content with the strict observation of the Churches rule, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the addition of other, or daily new prayers. There are a second sort (much more numerous) whose harder lott it was, to be bred up in factious daies, and haply amongst factious men, who have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never known what the Church of <hi>England</hi> was, till they saw it restored,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:40528:112"/> soon grew sensible of the whimsies and Fantastiall waies in which they had been kept, and whatever share they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily had thereof, seriously repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and, with a sweet mixture of peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent sorrow and joy, betook themselves into the arms of their mother, blessing God that they had lived to see, whence in truth they were descended. Many of these haveing tasted much devout af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection under the <hi>conceived way,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they really like, and right piously use, our Liturgy yet cannot but have a mindful kindness for the sober use of that other kind of prayer, which hath often affected them; and therefore would not willingly have all exercise thereof precluded or forborn There are a third sort, much the worst, but vastly the most, who are of our Church, because it's that which is at present uppermost in these Kingdomes, and would be of any that should be so. And of these there are two sorts: The first are men <hi>of Gallio's</hi> temper, <hi>not careing for these thinges,</hi> not at all concern'd as touching matters of Religion. They esteem it fitting perhaps that some Religion there
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:40528:112"/> should be in every state, but what kind, is to them no point of moment. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, under our Religion it ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been a custome to have a prayer, of the Ministers making or conceiving, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sermon, many of these very people, purely out of ill nature, would clamour against us, and call us idle, dull, unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of what we have, should we lay down, or omit such Useage: As the man said of two Sermons a day, so stand these men for such prayers, <hi>they will have them, not that they care for them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause their Minister is paid for them,</hi> as they apprehend. Another sort there is of these Temporizers, who are nearer of <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his state, when he first ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted himself to our Lord: in their hearts they have a real kindness for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and, had they their wills, they would have another constitution of it than what is publickly settled by law; but it is not their interest, or they have not selfe denial or fortitude enough to profess thus much, &amp; therefore they are content to swim with the stream. I dare not say, but amongst these there may be many sincere persons, because
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:40528:113"/> our establisht Religion, in those very points, which gratify not all mens hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, education or custome, is yet so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, that though it do not every way please some mens fancies, yet it can hardly thwart any understanding mans conscience: and therefore acquitting these men from acting against conscience, and onely judging them to suppress some opinion or inclination of more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable affection, I am enforced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude there many be sincerity amongst them. Now certain it is, the farr grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test number of these have a great Zeal for conceived prayer, and would not so much comply as they do, should all use thereof be taken away. In summe, of these three sorts of our people, which I have thus given account of, the first it is plain is not indeed by any forbearence of conceived prayer to be lost; but of the second, it may be feared, many would be: and of the third sort, a multitude who are perfect <hi>Neuters</hi> in religion would clamour against us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40528:113"/> should by such meanes make all of them more adverse, and ready to take parties against us, when ever oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity should offer.</p>
                     <p>I ought not to omit, that of those who hold off from our communion, there are many who come in frequently into our congregations, when the service is over, and both diligently heare and well like our sermons: now these people are told by those, who have prejudiced them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, or seduced them from our Church, that one reason of our Ministers useing the Commonprayer is because they are carnal men, not haveing true grace, and so destitute of the spirit of prayer, and of those gifts, which themselves and their brethren have: and that because we want them our selves, we would sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press them in others. Now to convince these people of the abominable delusion and cheat, which is put upon them, there can be no more effectual expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, than the modest exercise of our abilities in this way; whereby it will be evident, that if in conceived prayer men are to speake sense, and what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the majesty of God, and this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:40528:114"/> without hesitancy, drawling, losses, and insignificant canting expletives, the generality of the conformable Clergy can out do these very leaders in their own magnified way. And it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but that many of their people have been so honest, that when they have discovered such cheats and slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours pretences as these, they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted those their seducers, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Communion of our Church: yea I perswade my self, there are many kept blindfold still amongst them, of so honest minds, that were they but deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from this misunderstanding, they would do the like▪<note place="margin">Sect. 5.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But here the great question will be, how far the Laws of our Church will bear with what we plead for? Will they, as they stand at present, allow any thing of arbitrary Forms or Conceived prayer, in any case? And if they will not, who then of our Clergy can pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice either, with a <hi>Salvo</hi> to his conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and duty?</p>
                     <p>In answer hereto, I do acknowledge, that whoso peruses and considers the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and injunctions of King <hi>Edw: VI,</hi>
                        <pb n="189" facs="tcp:40528:114"/> or Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> will not there find, to the best of my memory, any thing that countenances either. And all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable interpretation, as far as I can see, which can reasonably be fixt on those Laws, to our purpose, will be to say, that whereas it is thereby ordained, that all Ministers should in their publick ministration use the Forms prescribed, and no other, we are to remember in what times those Laws were made, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on the then state of things; and then the words and no other, may be conceived to have been peculiarly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended against the <hi>Romish Missal, Brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie,</hi> and <hi>Ritual,</hi> the onely <hi>open prayers</hi> which in those dayes appeared against our Liturgy: and consequently we may conceive, that whatever Minister, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and constantly, uses the Common Prayers of the Church, and, onely in such cases wherein nothing is in strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness peremptorily injoined, a prayer of his own, conform to the Doctrine of the Church, is not thereby a Transgressour of the Law, in its principal intent and design. But I do not forget that I have spoken some thing already, which may

                     <p>Now as to <hi>later Lawes</hi> (though the <hi>later</hi> alwayes, the <hi>more of force,</hi> where there appears any thing of an <hi>Antinomy</hi>) I cannot say there are any such in our Church, wherein it was the intention of the Lawgiver to <hi>allow</hi> the free use of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Forms, or Conceived prayer, so much as before Sermon. But waving a while the intention of the Lawgiver, if we may stand to the words of a later <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> (which shall by me be allowed to be an Ecclesiastical Law) I do judge that interpreting them in a favourable sense, we may find something which gives a <hi>permission,</hi> though possibly not a <hi>plain allowance</hi> to such use as we plead for. And then the <hi>practice</hi> of approved men, and a general <hi>conniveance</hi> at this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, wheresoever it has been soberly and peaceably used, from those whom it has from time to time (so long in a manner as may be accounted <hi>prescriptory</hi>) concerned to execute the lawes, will make the permission much more consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. Before I proceed to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar proof, for the prevention of such

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:40528:117"/> most pious and religious persons judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but I am able to see no other pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage in our Ecclesiastical laws, on which he could ground it, than the LV Canon of 1603, above insinuated. The <hi>title</hi> of the <hi>Canon</hi> is, <hi>The Form of Prayer to be used by Preachers before their Sermon.</hi> Yet in the <hi>body</hi> of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non is <hi>no form</hi> of prayer prescribed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Lords prayer for conclusion, onely heads set down for bidding of prayer, according to former useage. The words of the Canon are: <hi>Before all Sermons Lectures and Homilies, Preachers and Ministers shall move the People to joyne with them in prayer, in this form, or to this effect, as brieffly as conveniently they may. Ye shall pray for the Church, &amp;c. All waies concludeing with the Lords Prayer.</hi> Now it is plain this Canon is very ambiguous; for it may be either understood of <hi>bidding</hi> of <hi>prayer</hi> (and as to the manner even of this, it leaves some liberty by those words <hi>in this form or to this effect</hi>) or of a <hi>form of prayer,</hi> which the preacher at his discretion may make, as briefe as conveniently may be,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:40528:117"/> compriseing the heads mentioned: which form may intervene, betwixt his <hi>move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (or calling upon) the people to pray, and the Lords prayer, as now the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon use of most preachers is. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the practice of men of greatest note in those dayes may seem to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min the Canon to the former &amp; more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive custome of <hi>bidding of prayer,</hi> yet if we do not understand the Canon of a <hi>form of Prayer,</hi> the <hi>title</hi> and <hi>body</hi> will not well accord. Upon the whole this am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity, &amp; appearance of interfereing of one part with the other is so notorious, that it cannot reasonably be judged unseen to the compilers of the Canon; and would seem therefore to have been designed by them, as a prudential kind of temper, for the gratifying all sober and peaceable men, however of a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent practice in this point: For it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the bidding of prayer, which most seems to be the thing injoynd, is yet so injoynd, as that the frameing a prayer on such and such heads (which was then become an usual practice) is not forbidden or censured, but rather, in the wording of the title and Canon, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niveance
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:40528:118"/> thereat insinuated. And this seemes the more probable to have been the Churches intention, for that in the Convocation held in the year 1640 it was proposed, that a short forme of prayer should be drawn up, compriseing the materialls specified in the Canon, which every Minister should use before his Sermon. And though such a form was prepared, and there was great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence that it would have been univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally received, yet the excellent Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop, President of the Convocation, putt a stop thereto; in all likelyhood conceiveing it fitter, tacitly to leave Preachers to their own discretion in this behalfe, than to make a new Canon contrariant to the old use, and former Kings and Queens injunctions.</p>
                     <p>In the Office of the <hi>Visitation</hi> of the <hi>sick,</hi> the exhortatory part indeed is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly left in a great measure to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters discretion. The words of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ick are, and all along have been, <hi>The Minister shall exhort the sick person in this form, or other like:</hi> which words, <hi>in this form or other like,</hi> whether they may not, in equity and by parity of reason, be
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:40528:118"/> extended to certain ensueing forms of prayer, ought to be considered. Sure it is, the dealing with the sick persons consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is afterwards wholely left, as to mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter of expression, to the Ministers prud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, some, &amp; but some, materialls onely being suggested, and no form prescribed. And from hence it seems but a natural consequent, that it is free for the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, as he sees occasion, and finds the sick mans condition to require, to enlarge or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ary the prayers. These are the utmost grounds, besides the observation of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved mens practice, which I can find for that reverend Doctors judgment. At least, this is the utmost of what I have, to say touching any favour or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, which our Ecclesiastical laws give to any other publick prayers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides those prescribed in the Liturgy, in any case whatsoever.</p>
                     <p>If it be said, Permission or Connive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, concluded from such favourable interpretation of laws, and from some mens practice (though approved per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons) is not sufficient to justify so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally irregular a practice as this is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be, I say, it is not now so irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:40528:119"/> as it was fifty or threescore yeares ago; (<hi>Consuetudo loci est lex loci</hi>) The state of things is much altered, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies of it, as it is pleaded for, cannot be considerable, if any, and the mischiefs arising from the forbearance of it would be intolerable. And I could further tell those, who most rigorously dissent from me, a thing in their ear, that there is another practice as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, publick and irregular, as what I urge or design, which they both allow, and daily join in, and dare not in their ordinary Congregations break off, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect, or intermit, notwithstanding it hath no more, from authority, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps never had, then bare permission or connivance, for its justification. It is said indeed in the Title-page of the <hi>English Psalms</hi> put into <hi>Metre</hi> by <hi>T. S. J. H.</hi> and others, that they were <hi>set forth and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be sung of all the people</hi> in our publick Congregations. But it is not specified, by whom they were allowed; and as to all Approbation or Allowance from tolerable Authority, those who have diligently searched after any possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble foot steps of it, could never yet find
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:40528:119"/> any, and are very confident there never was any. But of this haply more else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. However here is a precedent of a practice as obnoxious, as this I plead for, which passes, and is like to pass, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent amongst us all. Let not them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore implead one another, whom the same cause joins.</p>
                     <p>And now I should not think i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> judge the utmost that may be done in the case of any Conceived prayer, or Forms of our own, without disobedience to the Laws of the Church: However I will speak it out with the freedome and ingenuity I promised. I account then, that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, above laid down, may make it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to use with prudence, sobriety, and submission to our Superiours, all the liberty which is left us: and, it being permitted to us, as would seem by what has been said, either to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sermon, or to comprise those heads, in the Canon suggested, in a prayer of our own, ending with the Lords Prayer, it can be no more a transgression of the Law commonly to vary our Forms, than it is simply to use a Form of our own
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:40528:120"/> private composure; for that every Form so varied is still supposed such. Now it cannot be denied, but that since the Conceived way has been so magnified and cried up, a multitude of persons of worth having exercised themselves much therein, it is come to a very considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble maturity and perfection. <hi>Many have run to and fro, and knowledge,</hi> or expert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in this case, <hi>is encreased.</hi> As to those therefore who are masters of such facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of speech, if <hi>before</hi> their <hi>Sermons,</hi> and sometimes in the <hi>Visitation of the sick,</hi> when any particularity of the Patients condition requires it, they do, upon some thought, employ that their ability, and thereby accommodate their prayers as closely as they can, with due modesty, gravity &amp; reverence to particular emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies and circumstances, I say (to speak in the Apostles language in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther case) <hi>I suppose it is good for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent necessity:</hi> nor can I see any disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence therein, except we should conceive some more particular restraint laid on such persons by their Superiours, than that which the Canon hath imposed. If it be said, that the practice of conceived
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:40528:120"/> Prayer, or such new varied Forms, will bring the Liturgy into contempt or flight, and so that indirectly and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence it is at once a transgression of all the Laws which prescribe the use of the Liturgy, and due reverence thereto, I answer by utter denying, that such moderate, discreet, and sober practice, as I have pleaded for, will ordinarily have such effect, and <hi>I</hi> have possibly some poor experience to the contrary. It will rather prove a grateful variety, adding new spirit and heat to the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the multitude, adorning and setting forth the <hi>Offerings of God;</hi> a point worthy our most serious zeal and study. Many possibly, that are scorners, will be scorners still: but this will tend rather to diminish, than encrease, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                     <p>I am very sensible how obnoxious to<note place="margin">Sect, 7.</note> censure these my concessions of the three or four last sections are, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected and surpriseing they may prove to any who have perused and considered the former discourse, and its purport. It may reasonably seem strange, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter evidence given touching the <hi>Vanity</hi>
                        <pb n="200" facs="tcp:40528:121"/> of the common pretences to the <hi>Gift</hi> of prayer, touching diverse inconveniences and the <hi>Novelty</hi> of the practice, as also the <hi>irregular methods</hi> by which it has <hi>prevailed,</hi> I should in any measure act the part of an advocate for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission or continuance of such practice. But <hi>I</hi> desire all such, who are apt to take offence at what I have now said, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, in what way I have pleaded for it; not for the sole and unlimited exercise of it at that rate, as it was, and still is by some practiced, but so regulated, as that the main inconveniences, thereof are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided; not as coordinate with, much lesse in opposition to, the Church Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, but onely as subservient thereto, and as <hi>I</hi> judge such sober and prudent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise thereof a mean to reconcile many good minded people to our ministry and Church. All wise men know, that amongst the multitude, what is best and most orderly is not alwayes most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, nor can be solely prevailed for. I never can think much on such cases as this, but that of the Stoick presently runs in my head.</p>

There is something, saith she, <hi>which is yet to be wisht:</hi> and 'tis sufficient to say what is establisht, is as well as for the time it could be. I have the same plea to enter for what I have
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:40528:122"/> yielded to the present <hi>Genius</hi> of the age. People will not be perswaded, but that in these days they stand upon the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of all who have lived before them, as they commonly say. For knowledge, parts and judgment, they will give place to none, but the inspired times; and 'tis well if, in all things, they will yield thereto. To shew them what those gifts are in truth, which they pretend to, is one way to make them sober: this I have honestly endeavoured. To deny any use of them, is to make our selves, in their judgment, mad or obstinate; and for us to pretend to be without them (or which is the same, to give no instances of them) is to draw upon our selves the censure of being scandalously unfit for the places we fill: Both these, as rockes, <hi>I</hi> have endeavoured to decline, <hi>I</hi> conclude: <hi>In secret,</hi> let every one use such words as most incite or help his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion (that being the sole intent of words in such prayer) or let him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare any, if he perceives them to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract him. This has ever been the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Church, and is ours. In <hi>Publick,</hi> who well considers what has
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:40528:122"/> been said, will preferre mature and well contrived forms, such as <hi>I</hi> may confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently say our Church has provided us, haveing far outdon all Churches, whose Liturgies I ever yet saw. And <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever</hi> the Church has permitted any thing to our <hi>Liberty,</hi> let no private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son dare to draw the reines straighter. Something of Variety there will be in diverse mens ministration, as long as men are diverse: and I cannot tell whether any man be ever so accomplisht, as that <hi>I</hi> may say, he is happy who never va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries from himself. Not to be content with such an Uniformity, as answers the law, is to be so far Nonconform. Let us therefore all rather study to use the liberty left us with prudence, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, and all sweetnesse of charity and peaceablenesse, each approveing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to God in the conscientious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the ministry committed to him, and not censuring his brother, who it may be would be what another is, but that he sees not so far and cannot. And <hi>Happy is he who condemneth not himself in that which he alloweth.</hi>

                        </gap>t, for the obteining what we want, that there are others due as well in return of gratitude for the Good things we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, as in acknowledgment of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Majesty, glory, and absolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, scarce requires proof. These addresses we commonly call the <hi>Praises</hi> of God. Now whether Nature first taught, or God by secret instinct, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, directed the rational part of his creation to offer them up in words fitted to melody, and melodiously ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, cannot perhaps be precisely deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: certain it is that <hi>singing to God</hi> was one of the <hi>first acts of worship</hi> paid him by any of his creatures. When God was now <hi>laying the foundations of the earth, The mornign starres sang together, and all the Sons of God shouted for joy.</hi> Job: XXXVIII. 7. If by the <hi>Morning Startes</hi> we are not to understand the Angels (as to me seems most probable,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:40528:125"/> both for that the earth was founded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the creation of the Starres (Gen: I) and because the like appellation is given to some of the angels (Isai: XIV▪ 12.) yet by the sons of God here, as well as ch: 1. 6, we can understand no other. It would seem therefore, that while the Glorious Creatour framed the Visible world, the elder part of his work, the invisible creation, sung his praise: and that which most imployed them herein, in all probalility was, the infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, power, wisdome and goodnesse of God, which displaied it selfe in his handy work. How angels <hi>speak</hi> or <hi>sing,</hi> none below an Angel can tell. We can therefore hence take no farther di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, for regulateing our practice, than this, that we are to <hi>praise</hi> God for his <hi>absolute excellence</hi> &amp; perfection, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever discovered by us; according to that of the Royal prophet, <hi>Praise him</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ps▪ C L.</note>
                        <hi>according to his excellent greatnesse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That all the generations of the old worldwere silent in thedivine praise, the honour &amp; charity we owethem will not suffer us to think, though in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they set it forth, we cannot say. It is
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:40528:126"/> not incredible that he who first found out <hi>Musick,</hi> and taught men to <hi>handle the Harp and the Organ,</hi> contained not himselfe long after the invention, but in joy and gratitude tuned them to the praise of the insp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rer. But the next in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, as far as yet I can observe, of praise sung to God, is in the case of the <hi>Israelites</hi> having passed the Red sea. The great subject of their song, was Gods miraculous mercies to them, and his no less mighty judgments on their Enemies. And here 'tis certain, they both sung in parts, and added instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to their song, <hi>Exod.</hi> XV. 1, 2, 20, 21. And since that time, <hi>singing</hi> Gods praise has in no age of the Church been disused▪ Before this; indeed, mankind may seem in a great measure to have conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselves in paying their homage and gratitude by sacrifice, <hi>Gen. IV.</hi> 3, 4. and <hi>VIII. 20, &amp;c.</hi> We may not, as I conceive, say, the Patriarchs were all along silent at their sacrifices: however, we are sure, since the constitution of the Church under <hi>Moses</hi> dumb sacrifices have not been usual.</p>
                     <p>That therefore in the publick assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:40528:126"/> of Christians for the Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, <hi>Singing praises</hi> to God and Christ, ought to take up a considerable part of the Common Service, I presume no so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber person will question or gainsay. That also we ought to praise God, as well for his own intrinseck worth and glory, as for the benefits which we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally, or the Church, and Mankind in general, receive at his hands is no less certain: That further, from the very infancy of Christianity to the present days, such practice has been constantly continued in the Church, though not onely the particular forms of Hymns, but the modes and adjuncts of singing them, have been very different, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the different state of Religion and the Church, and the gradual advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of art, will be as easily admitted. That sinally the inward manner of sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the <hi>Melody of the heart,</hi> that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout affection and frame of soul, which ought inseparably to accompany all our singing, and without which no voice or sound can be pleasing in the ears of God, is most to be attended and provided for, is together with what yet said,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:40528:127"/> matter of general accord.</p>
                     <p>But the duty at large being thus<note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> soon concluded, it is not so easie to set down, beyond contradiction, due Rules for the best kind of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, or to define what particular manner of it is together must acceptable to God, and most conduceing to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ion of the faithfull. There may reasonably be conceived doubts touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the subject matter or argument of what is to be sung, whether meer scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or also Hymnes of humane compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; then touching the form of words, whether metrical or plain prose; again touching the very manner of singing, whether onely with the voice or with conjunction thereof with Musical in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, as is our present Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usage. In all these points and such other, it is necessary it should be stated, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as we can, what is the best and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test use, at least what is lawful and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Christian state, as well for the satisfaction of mens consciences, as for their direction in this their common du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And for resolution in all these, <hi>I</hi> shall direct distinct enquiries unto the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:40528:127"/> ensueing heads. 1. What was the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in the <hi>inspired Church?</hi> How the faithful then were qualified for this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and what rules are laid down by the inspired authours for its performance? 2. Wherein the <hi>Melody</hi> of the heart, spoken of by the Apostle, consisteth? The point, which is mainly regarded by God and to be heeded by us. 2. What has, since the inspired daies, been all along the practice of the Church? And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this head, what in several ages has been the growth &amp; progresse of Church Musick. 4. Whether the present prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of our Church may be justifyed by the forementioned authorities? 5. What may be done for the manageing this our present practice to the most spiritual ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage? In answer to all which I shall endeavour to carry the same temper, which I mainteined in the former dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; and therefore beseech my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, abandoning all interest, prejudice, and partiality, freely to attend my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings, and weigh their force, I haveing, as most sincerely I can avow, no greate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> design than the promoting serious piety, truth and peace.</p>
                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:40528:128"/>
                     <p>In order to the takeing a full view of the Practice of the <hi>Inspired</hi> age (which<note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> was the first point to be enquired into) it will be requisite to consider two things, as above insinuated. First how the faithful of those daies were qualified for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this duty, being most of them plain and unletterd people; and and then what rules those, who were certainly inspired men have given for management of such qualifications or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, which are in those daies supposed to have been bestowed on the faithful. For according to these two certainly was the practice.</p>
                     <p>As to the Former of these: We have above said, God has in no age been wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to his Church; and what any age has not had by ordinary means, he has supplied in an extraordinary course. When therefore the generality of the faithful were not qualified with abilities, got in the common way, for the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the divine praise, it pleased God, amongst other miraculous gifts of the spirit, which he poured out on his Church, to infuse into many a spiritual gift facilitateing them in the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:40528:128"/> of this part of the divine worship, and supplying them both with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp; words, &amp; these too in due form for the praise of God. Thus much we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand by St. <hi>Paul.</hi> (1. Cor▪ X<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e inspired pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, forms as it were dictated to the Faithful by the spirit, so were there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so inspired Hymnes or Psalms: they <hi>sung with the spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now as to this <hi>spiritual Gift of sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> thus miraculously infused, what must it be? Shall we say, skill in song, or the art of musick was inspired into the primitive Christians by the Holy Ghost? I will acknowlege Musick indeed an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment worthy of the Holy Ghost for its author, fitt to come from heaven, both for its sweetnesse and its power. And if <hi>Bezaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiah</hi> are said to be <hi>filled with the Spirit of God</hi> in respect of those meaner mechanical
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:40528:129"/> arts, in which they were so skillful, much morè justly might we conceive the first <hi>sweet singers</hi> in the Christian <hi>srael</hi> inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red even in regard of their melodious concent. But this was not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles intention: For by his opposeing <hi>Singing with,</hi> or by, the <hi>Spirit,</hi> to <hi>sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the understanding,</hi> so that he who sung in his sense meerly <hi>with the spirit,</hi> did not also sing <hi>with the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing</hi> that is (as before said in the case of like prayer) did not <hi>distinctly</hi> understand what he sung, it is plain the spiritual gift here meant must be such, as furnished or supplied what was sung. And this is further evident, from the 26th. <hi>verse. How is it then Brethren</hi> saith the Apostle; <hi>When ye come together Every</hi> one <hi>of you</hi> [inspired persons] <hi>hath a Psalm, hath a doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. That, which was the particular product or effect of the Gift of <hi>singing,</hi> was a <hi>Psalm</hi> a new, and by virtue of this gift, conceived (as that, which was the product of the gift of <hi>Teaching,</hi> was a <hi>doctrine,</hi> or discourse for the instruction of the hearers) and that <hi>Psalme</hi> inspired, not so much as to any meer musical utterance or singing
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:40528:129"/> of it, as to its substance and musical Form. What was thus by the spirit ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, as to its <hi>substance</hi> and sense, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the praise of God and <hi>Christ;</hi> and as to its <hi>Form,</hi> it was <hi>fit to be sung:</hi> and, upon the whole, was therefore a <hi>Christian Psalm;</hi> which the same Apostle, as I conceive, elsewhere calls a <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al song,</hi> because thus immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from supernaturall inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Shall we then now conclude, we have the due notion of the spiritual gift of singing, or of <hi>singing by the spirit?</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the main we have: it is a kind of <hi>inspired Poesie.</hi> But yet particularly in the place mentioned, it is certain the Apostle designed a stricter acceptation of the phrase, than what has yet been delivered, according as has been above made out touching the same Text, as a part of it relates to prayer. For, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready noted, <hi>Singing with the spirit</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opposed to <hi>singing with the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,</hi> it must follow that the Psalm, or Holy Song, conceiued by such gift, was conceived in an unknown Tongue, and that in some measure unknown to
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:40528:130"/> the very person who uttered it. Not but that such persons knew, in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, what they were employed in, when they thus sung, and might possibly have some coufused sense of the main drift or import of what the spirit moved them to utter, which sense might raise much holy zeal and fervour of divine love, with many other acts of Christian Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in them (in respect of which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith, such persons speaking thus in an unknown Tongue edified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. though he suppose them still so far ignorant of the Tongue they spoke in, as that they could not utter, what they thus said, in their Mother Tongue, that is, could not <hi>interpret, ver. 13, 14, &amp;c.</hi>) but a distinct notion of each sentence and word of such Psalm, by this spiritual gift thus uttered, it is plain by the Apostles whole scope they wanted (whatsoever some learned men say to the contrary) as will appear to any, who shall duly consider the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>scourse there, and compare therewith the interpretation of it, by me here and above given. <hi>Singing then with the spirit</hi> there signifies in strictness,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:40528:130"/> an inspired faculty of some sort of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Poetry, even in strange and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Tongues.</p>
                     <p>But although those particular <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> of whom the Apostle there speaks, had this gift onely in strange Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, it will not follow that it was ever thus confined or Eclipsed. There were certainly others, both of that and other Churches, who by a spiritual gift were able to sing in their own Tongue, and did so, <hi>as the spirit gave them utterance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And in this sense, the <hi>Spirit of sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> or inditing the divine praise, was not then altogether a new thing. For though it had been some time disconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, from the cessation of Prophets, yet before that cessation it had been conspicuous enough in the Church. By virtue of the inspiration hereof at some extraordinary seasons, several more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Saints have conceived the divine praise in most lofty and divine Forms, uttered upon the sudden as the occasion required; which could not have been done, so elegantly and exquisitely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an immediate <hi>afflatus</hi> or breathing of the Holy Ghost. Of this Origin, and no

And we have the same expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, more than once in the undoubted Canon of Scripture: particularly touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                        <hi>Zacharias,</hi> on an occasion like to that of <hi>Hanna's,</hi> Luke 1. 67. <hi>And</hi> Zacharias <hi>was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied, saying, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he hath visited and redeemed his people. And &amp;c.</hi> where <hi>prophesying</hi> must needs signifie his extraordinary for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and uttering that inspired Hymn; and his being <hi>filled with the Holy Ghost,</hi> the inspiration which enabled him thereto. Proportionably also to this sense, are to be understood those Texts in the Old Testament, where we read of particular persons at certain times, prophesying to the Psaltery, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> Numb. XI. 25. <hi>it came to pass when the spirit rested on them, they prophesied,</hi>
                        <pb n="222" facs="tcp:40528:132"/> And to name no more places, 1 <hi>Chron. XXV. 1. David separated</hi> certain of <hi>the sons of</hi> Asaph, <hi>and of</hi> Heman, <hi>and of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duthun, <hi>who should prophesie with Harps, with Psalteries and Cymbals.</hi> By these and several other passages, that might be alledged, it is plain that there was, in the ancient inspired times of the Jewish Church, a certain <hi>spiritual gift</hi> enabling those particular persons who had it, at such times as they had it, to indite, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and sing the <hi>praise</hi> of God, and that so, as to be understood and taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by all who heard them.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore the former and more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral notion, though it is not more proper to that Text of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> yet is more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the nature of the thing. The gift of singing then, in its true latitude, was I say a kind of <hi>inspired divine Poesie,</hi> taking here <hi>Poesie</hi> for a <hi>Poetical faculty.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This possibly may, if not offend some, who are as unmerciful to Poetry, as <hi>Plato</hi> was to Poets, yet not be readily received by all others. For it may seem reasonable, that as the first Christian singing was little else but an harmonious plain pronunciation, so their Christian
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:40528:132"/> songs or Psalms, were plain prose, &amp; wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all Poetical form. In answer whereto I say, that however it is not impossible, that there may be some men of such an odd natural temper, as to be neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with Poetry nor Musick, yet it is most certain the spirit of God is no such enemy to either, both of them haveing proceeded thence, and been conducted thereby. As to Musick more anon in a more proper place: our present dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is more concernd touching Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Now that the praises of God were conceived in Poetical form, by the direction and inspiration of the Holy Ghost, under the old testament, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond denial. How much soever is lost as to the knowledge of the old <hi>Hebrew</hi> Poesy, we are sure we have thus much skill therein, still left, as that we are able to distinguish betwixt the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Verse and Prose. And we are sure particularly, that whereas the one and thirty first Chapters of <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> are writ in <hi>Prose,</hi> the two and thirtieth chapter, to the fourty third verse, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively, that is the whole song of <hi>Moses,</hi> is writ in <hi>Verse:</hi> and yet these forty three
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:40528:133"/> verses, though strictly a Poem, are no less scripture, or of the Holy Ghosts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diteing, than is the rest of the book which is Prose. The same have we to say touching the Song of the <hi>Israelites, Exod.</hi> XV. the Book of Psalms, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the old Testament. Now where is the inconvenience in admitting, that the same Holy spirit, which under the old Testament inspired the praises of God for the publick use of the Church in Poeticall form, might also do the same under the Gospel state? Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when this <hi>Ministration was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed</hi>

Nay, if we may take words to signifie in scripture, what they signify every where, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Authours and by common consent, it is sure, the praises of God were, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Christian state, thus inspired; and the gift, which we are now treating of, inabled men, otherwise than by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration unskillful, thus to indite them.</p>
                     <p>We find, in two of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles,<note place="margin">Sect 5.</note> three several terms relateing, as it would seem, to those praises of God, which the

Thus I have already said a <hi>Spiritual song</hi> is called (1. <hi>Cor.</hi> XIV. 26.) a <hi>Psalm:</hi> and probably <hi>a Psalm (Mat:</hi> XXV, 30) is called an <hi>Hymn,</hi> viz. by reason of that common nature, wherein they agree: but the Apo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tle, in those two places mentioned, seeming to enumerate, or particularise, all the several forms of divine praise then in use, it will be most proper there to take them under different, and each in their strict noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; though what those are, in so great variety of Gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>We will now examin what scripture has superadded to the common notions of these words. In the places above mentioned, to the words <hi>songs</hi> is added <hi>Spiritual.</hi> This, say Commentatours, is in opposition to the lewd and lascivious songs, which were the great entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of heathen mirth. It may be so: but:
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:40528:135"/> though there appear some colour for the Antithesis in the immediate context, <hi>Eph.</hi> V, yet none in <hi>Coloss:</hi> III: and the form of speech so neerly agreeing in both, I rather incline to interpret <hi>Spiritual songs,</hi> as before insinuated, of songs indited by the Holy Ghost in the praise of God and Christ, and uttered by virtue of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar spiritual Gift, according to the passage of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> so fully, I presume, cleared. But Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all, it they were spiritual songs in any sense, they were songs still, and therefore according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon import of the word, which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say scripture hath varied, indited in some Poetical form. As to the term <hi>Psalms,</hi> I am able to observe little or noad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to it, or variation of it in scripture from that its common notion before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, saveing onely that it is in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alwayes used in an holy sense. It certainly signifies in the old testament Hymnes designed to be used with instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental musick: and in the new it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and that with great reasons, to have a particular reference to the book of Psalms.

                     <p>The Scripture Notion of <hi>Hymnes</hi> is yet behind: and though I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member my self to have ever met with any Hymnes in profane Authours, but what were writ in verse, properly so called, yet it must be acknowledged otherwise in the Holy Writings. To the nature of a Scripture-Hymn, it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that it contain the praises of God, however indited, whether in verse or in prose. And indeed it may be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved amongst the very Heathens, that though most of their Hymnes now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant are writ in strict verse, observing usual measures and numbers, yet they had a freer sort of Poetry, called <hi>Dithy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rambick,</hi> wherein sometimes they used to celebrate the acts and natures of their Gods.

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:40528:138"/> Hymn in the Old Testament, which is not indited by the Holy Ghost in Poeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal form. As to those in the New, the Hymns of the Blessed <hi>Mary,</hi> of <hi>Zachari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> and of <hi>Simeon,</hi> it is sure we have them not in their Originals, (for they were undoubtedly uttered in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> at least in some Dialect thereof, however they come to us in <hi>Greek</hi>) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we cannot make so exact a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them. Onely this we may say: that even in the <hi>Greek</hi> appears some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> Poetical character of speech, before described: and let any one compare the <hi>Magnificat</hi> with <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s Song, and he will soon say, the frame and style of both is so like, that as the one, being in <hi>Hebrew,</hi> is verse, so would the other be also, were it in that language; and consequently, that in all probability it was at first Poetical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indited. And the same in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may as reasonably be concluded of the other. That address of the Church (<hi>Acts IV.</hi> 24.) which the Learned <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In Mat. 26.</note> reckons amongst the New-Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hymns, I do not see how to make an Hymn of, there being not one strain
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:40528:139"/> in it properly laudatory; but it is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an occasional prayer, indited indeed I confess by the Holy Ghost; and so an instance of inspired prayers, as those above mentioned are instances of inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Hymns. Those Hymns in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi> which St. <hi>John</hi> heard sung by the Heavenly inhabitants, are confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly prose, though in what form or language he heard them, or conceived himself to hear them, we cannot speak. However therefore in regard as well of them, as of the <hi>Magnificat, Benedictus</hi> and the <hi>Nunc dimittis,</hi> and of other such (if there be any other) Hymns in the New Testament, I have said, it is sufficient to the constitution of a Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture hymn, that it contain the praise of God, in what form soever it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</p>
                     <p>In summe, it appearing by what I have said, that both <hi>Psalms</hi> and <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual songs</hi> were alwayes of <hi>poetical</hi> form, and Psalms beyond question indited in that very form by the Holy Ghost; that also <hi>Hymn,</hi> were most usually of like form, by the instinct and conduct of the same Holy Ghost; and finally, that
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:40528:139"/> the <hi>spiritual gift</hi> was a supernatural fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of conceiving and uttering new spiritual Songs and Hymns, it is most reasonable to conclude the spiritual gift or <hi>spirit of singing,</hi> spoken of as above by the Apostle, to have been a certain kind of <hi>inspired Divine-poesie;</hi> truly enough so called, though not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining it self to the stricter and more curious rules of the <hi>Graecian</hi> or <hi>European</hi> use.</p>
                     <p>It follows now that we proceed to<note place="margin">Sect. 6.</note> such rules, which Authours undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly inspired by the Holy Ghost, have laid down for the due managing of this gift, and regulating the Office of <hi>sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to God: and that we consider in what proportion they are accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable to our present age. Two Rules we may deduce from that Text of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> where we have the for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>First, when he sayes, <hi>I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing also,</hi> it is plain he allows it as a justifiab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e design of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> zeal, that there should be <hi>singing with
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:40528:140"/> the spirit:</hi> that is (to wave what was extraordinary and peculiar to that state of the Church; and to speak in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as well as with proportion to the condition of the present Church) There ought to be in the praises of God, both Elegance and Harmony. Elegance ariseth from the proper, neat and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent choice of sense and words. Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, first from the aptness of the words to Musick, and thus far Poetry goes; and then from the application of Musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Notes to the words, which, when done with humane voice, we call <hi>sing<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now both these, I say, the Apostle concludes ought to be in the praises of God, which Christian people, either more privately, or the Church in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, offer up unto him. For the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual gift, by the conduct of which the Apostle would have them sing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no principle of slovenliness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handsome expression, nor of harshness and confused jargon, but of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, when he sayes <hi>I will sing with the spirit,</hi> he plainly resolves, both these are to be desired and endeavoured in
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:40528:140"/> the praise of God: and he expressing himself indefinitely, we may extend the singing he speaks of to all instances of it, publick or private. For further clearing of this point we are to consider, that it may be said touching the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians generally, they had neither learning nor art, and yet they had both. They had neither, as got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the common methods of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Exercise: they had both as immediately inspired into them by God. Arts and Learning were ever in the Christian Church, onely the manner of attaining to them has been different. So then, when the Apostle saith, <hi>I will sing with the spirit,</hi> it is as much as if he had said, what Learning and Arts there are, apt for the publick or private praise of God, in the Church, should be employed and used in the offering up his praise. This onely is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the then state of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian</hi> Church, and the present age: they <hi>sung by the spirit,</hi> when they sung in the elegance and harmony, which the Holy Ghost had immediately inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into them; we sing by the spirit,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:40528:141"/> when we sing with such elegance and harmony, as we have acquired by the common influence of the Holy Ghost upon our industry, and use of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry methods. However 'tis plain, if both are to sing with the spirit, the work of that spirit being abilities qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying persons for this office of singing, both are to sing with some elegance and harmony, onely each with such as respectively they have. This then is the summe of the first Rule, that as the inspired persons were to exercise their gifts; so we, what more common skill we have, meet to the purpose, in singing the Divine praise.</p>
                     <p>The second Rule we must fetch out of the same place, and particularly from those words, <hi>and I will sing with the understanding also.</hi> The Rule will be this; that all Art which is used, or which may be allowed in the praise of God, ought to be consistent with those praises being distinctly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood; and that both by the persons, who utter them, and the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which hears, and so is to join there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, at least by consent. This is most
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:40528:141"/> plain from the words already alledged, and may further appear from what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follows <hi>ver. 16, &amp; 17. Eise when thou shalt bless with the spirit (viz.</hi> by thy spiritual gift, or art as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said <hi>

                     <p>A third Rule we are to fetch, from comparing the Text now mentioned, with those above alledged, touching <hi>Psalms,</hi> and <hi>Hymns,</hi> and spiritual Songs. <hi>Ephes.</hi> V. 19. <hi>Colos. III.</hi> 16, and that of St. <hi>James,</hi> chap. V. 13. <hi>Is any of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:40528:142"/> you merry, let him sing Psalms.</hi> I have said above, St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaking of singing indefinitely in the Text to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> the passage may be understood of publick or private singing to God: and it is plain by the Context there, a man might sing by the spirit to his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate edification, as well as to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick benefit of the Church. However, the Apostle by the scope of his discourse, driving there more at publick than pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate performances, it will be meet to take notice, that the two other places of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and that of St. <hi>James,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join singing as Christian mens private entertainment. <hi>Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled with the Holy Ghost: speaking to your selves</hi> (or to one another) <hi>in Psalms and Hymns, &amp;c.</hi> Let not your mirth be that mad, revelling jollity of the Heathen, but in your private rejoycings, when you are together, entertain your selves with the praise of God; such joy both better becoming Christians, and being of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter consequence. The same evidently is the sense of the other places. Now from hence the Rule is, that singing to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:40528:142"/> God is not onely an office of publick Worship, but an exercise which should employ Christian people in their more private congress, in their Families, and as occasion serves, in their very soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude too, at least oftner than general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they assemble together in publick. It is really to be lamented, that many in our age will scarce hear of private Psalmody, but, because both it and some other Christian practices have been made stalking-horses and blinds by some hypocritical men, therefore inveigh against it &amp; such other holy exercises, as bespeaking onely a Puritanical or Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick spirit. A like sad is it, that so many thousand excellent Wits, one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration after another, still evaporate onely in froth or lust. Certainly it were much more noble, and worthier of our <hi>Beaux Esprits,</hi> of our lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>And the decency certainly ought to be considered, in regard both of the matter sung, and the manner of sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. As to the matter sung in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired Church of old: No doubt but the Holy Ghost, who inspired into those primitive Saints, Psalsm, Hymns, or spiritual Songs, that is, the praise of God in fit from to be sung, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded much more for the fitness and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of the subject matter, than for any exactness of outward form; that was most heavenly, pure, and every way apposite and congruous to the age and occasion. And accordingly our first and chiefest care, in discharge of our present duty of singing to god, ought to be, that the subject matter of our Hymns be duly chosen, that it be becoming the Majesty of God, and sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the condition and state of the Church. It is to be remembred, that there is a vast difference betwixt the Legal and Evangelical state, betwixt the <hi>Mosaical</hi> and Christian Worship,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:40528:144"/> promises and hopes. Though there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with due application, and taken in a Christian sense, we may with great advantage sing <hi>Davids</hi> Psalms (of which more hereafter) yet it is very certain, there ought to be Hymns in more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press and direct Christian terms than are those, which were properly calculated for another Oeconomy: nor can any man imagine, that what was once fit for the service of God under the Law, and as such dictated by the Holy Ghost, is therefore eternally meet &amp; seasonable, or most proper for a Christian Quire. Much less is it tolerable, that things should be foisted in to the Publick Lauds, because the words in which they are expressed, are of a rowling or jingling sound, and tickle the ear or fancy of an empty Musician. The pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, by her Canons, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the direction what should be sung, to deeper and graver judgments. Again, there is a <hi>Decorum,</hi> as to the very manner and kind of the Musick, which is to be observed. Musick is therefore used in the Worship of God, because of the power it hath upon the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:40528:144"/> mind of man, to raise good affections and calm disorderly ones. That Musick therefore, which in stead of exciting devotion, and composing the soul to a sedate and fixed temper, onely moves light &amp; giddy thoughts, induces an aiery humour, and sporting, frisking dancing passions, is altogether to be banished the Christian Worship. To set Anthems or Services in the way of Madrigals or Galliards (as some of late have in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner done) is to debauch Devotion, to pervert the Worship of God, and as it were to take pains to make men wanton therein: And it certainly argues either want of judgment, information of, or attention to the true ends of <hi>Church-Musick,</hi> or want of seriousness, and a real fear of God, in the hearts of all such, who either introduce or affect such practice. For those Mercurial nimble-finger'd men, are either sensible of the natural effects of such Musick up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the generality of Mankind, or not: if they are, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="398" facs="tcp:40528:145"/> of ignorance in the power of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Art and Humane nature.</p>
                     <p>As to any conducency to edification, arising from order kept in singing, I do not see much to be wanting in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of our Church. First, there is no other Office actually engaging the Congregation, when Divine Hymns are sung, but that all both may and ought attend thereto, and, distinctly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting, join therein. Then, in our <hi>Cathedral use,</hi> there are none to sing but such who may pass, in the style of the old Canon, for <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar<note place="margin">Conc. Laod. Can. 15.</note> fingers, who if they observe their rule (as they are generally able to do) can neither be presumed to disturb the Congregation, nor one the other; but all sweetly to conspire in such utterance of the praise of God, as must needs draw forth the affections, and engage the hearts of all such who are not stupid or heedless. And as to such others of the Congregation, who strike in at the <hi>Chorus</hi>'s, or Versicles, or in chanting the Psalms, and such like parts of the Service, these are all exercised or skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful persons, and create no interruption
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:40528:145"/> to the devotion of any, but only make up the consent much fuller. In the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial</hi> use, especially of singing the Metrical Version of the Psalms, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice is indeed obnoxious. It is hard to say whether the Metre, the usual choice of Psalms by the Parish-Clerks, or the peoples singing be worse: all is pitiful and mean; and especially the singing oftentimes full of ungrateful jarres, discords, squeaks, screeches, roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. which severally I wish brought to a more regular, comely and orderly course; and what may be done private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and without any noise, to this purpose, I shall hereafter consider. But the present disorderly practice, is no constitution of our Churches: at the utmost, it has been onely permitted, out of a kind of necessity, to the will of the people, because yet it could be no better; and therefore it is not to be imputed to our Church, especially by such who are adverse to her Laws, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no sort of men so stiffe for this practice as themselves. Lastly, as to the interweaving Hymns, sometimes with Lessons of Holy Scripture, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:40528:146"/> with prayers, though some men have spoken against it, I sincerely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess my self to judge it a most reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and profitable Order. For, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing suggests occasion, matter, and fresh thoughts for the praise of God. Praise again, whets and quickens the mind for new attention to the truths of the Gospel, or Rules of Holy Life. And prayer derives and fetches down a fresh influence of the divine grace, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposing, and as it were, molding the heart into a softer and more zealous temper for praise. Thus by an happy enterchange, one Office <hi>makes ready</hi> or <hi>prepares the way</hi> to another, and a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful variety through the whole Service, takes off the <hi>Taedium</hi> of all, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the performance, though of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable length, pleasing even to flesh and bloud.</p>
                     <p>Now supposing these Rules observed, that the praises of God are gracefully indited, that they are intelligibly ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, that the matter be meet and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and the manner of singing grave and reverent, and all orderly perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (which are, in summe, the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:40528:146"/> Rules laid down) what can there be wanting to make up such a consent and symphony, as shall be acceptable and delightful to God, but that <hi>Inner Part</hi> which the Apostle calls <hi>Melody in</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eph. V</note> (or of) <hi>the Heart?</hi> And what that imports, we will now examine as a fit close to these Apostolical Rules.</p>
                     <p>To <hi>sing and make melody to the Lord</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Lyra.</note> directing the intention of this praise to the Lord; more fully <hi>Theophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact,</hi> with <hi>understanding, attention, and an heart not rambling.</hi> In summe, to comprehend all, The <hi>melody of the heart</hi> consists in a sweet concord and agreement of all those inward rational powers, which are fit to be imploied in the divine praise. And therefore, distinctly, to make up a <hi>full melody of the heart,</hi> there is a threefold care to be taken, and no point thereof any solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude to modulate the voice: for that is supposed to be habitually done by art and custome, as by a second nature;
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:40528:147"/> and to be, in a manner, as facil and ready as speech: nor should any singing, by grown and adult persons, be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the solemn Service of God, but what is performed by such, to whom it is become thus natural.</p>
                     <p>The first point of care must be in <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> to what we sing in the praise of God; I do not mean to the Notes, for this too many are too apt to, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themselves with, but unto the words and their import. I appeal to any mans conscience and common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; should there be no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween hearing an Anthem, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an ordinary Song or Catch? to the later men attend onely for delight and divertisement, and therefore princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally heed the Musick. To the other they do, or ought to, attend as to a sacrifice of divine praise offered up to God, by their consent, so as, thereby at least, to join with the performers in the offering it up; and therefore men ought primarily to attend unto the sense, to the end they may be ready in each part with such their consent; and onely secundarily, and by the by, to
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:40528:147"/> the Musick, that thereby their souls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more inflamed or quickened, might with more fervour present their share in the spiritual sacrifice, which not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God as Judge, but Angels as holily emulous attend unto.</p>
                     <p>A second point, which should exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise our care in singing is <hi>Intention,</hi> or real designing, desiring and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give to God that praise with our mind and full consent, which our words import. <hi>Psalmis &amp; Hymnis cum oratis</hi>

This a man may do, say some great pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Masters in devotion, by consenting to the Service and all Hymns, which the Church shall offer, before he comes to them. A general agreeing thereto suffices, and particular intention is not of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary essence of devotion.

                        <q>The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour reckons (that is, understands to be reckoned) all want of Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (and so of intention) through negligence, to be included under such want purposely and on design.—For such negligence being voluntary, therefore also is the Non-attention which arises thence voluntary also: and therefore sinful, and as bad as to invite a Guest, and under a mans ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry own roof visely to intreat him.</q> According to the doctrine then of this great man, if through negligence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention be wanting, there must be sin in such devotions; and much more, if through design. Now whether amongst
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:40528:148"/> them, a distinct and actual attention and intention be not both wanting through design, and that too through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of their Church, when all their solemn and publick Services, being by their Church contrived into a form un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible by the common people, are onely so officiated by their Priests, let them answer. We may expect they will acquit themselves, when they can make out, that a man ordinarily may actually and distinctly attend and intend such sense, of which he has not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. But let the <hi>Romists</hi> pass: if there be any amongst our selves who think such intention, as I speak of, is not necessary to make up the <hi>melody of the heart,</hi> I will onely desire such to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the following case. Whether, if I were to pay any solemn Homage, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with thanks for some peculiar acts of grace, to my Prince, and I should, before such address made, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend so to do, and generally consent to the form of address; but when it were to be offered, though I came my self into the Presence to join in the tender, I should negligently withdraw my self from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:40528:149"/> any hand in the actual tender, and employ my self aside in little idle diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements with other things or persons, whether I say this demeanour would be accepted, or rather not construed as a contempt? Might I seem hereby to have paid my fealty, with all good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and humble duty? No man can enforce himself to think so. Now of the same nature must that mans devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be, who onely consents that certain praise shall be offered up to God, &amp; by outward joining therein, as it were, puts himself into the Presence chamber of Gods Majesty, but then neglects God, &amp; concurs not to the address by any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant actual intention. Onely the mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is so much more solemn, by how much God is the greater Soveraign. Let it therefore stand, that whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver would sing in a manner pleasing and harmonious to God, must not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, at the first access, bring into his presence a general intention of offering praise, or paying worship to him, but also, throughout attending (as before said) to the sense and substance of what is offered, maintain all along a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:40528:149"/> consent, and distinct actual inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to the several particulars and members of such addresses, as shall be presented to his Majesty: and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever this attention and distinct inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fails, there is a kind of <hi>chasme</hi> in the <hi>melody of the heart.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lastly, (what is but a further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication or carrying on of such distinct intention as above directed) to the end <hi>every part</hi> of this <hi>inward melody</hi> may be <hi>full,</hi> it is requisite that the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> be in some measure engaged (at least as they may be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

In the exercise of Humility, or a deep sense not onely of our own undeservingness, but of our evil deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings at Gods hands, and together of his infinite perfection, goodness, grace or free bounty. The Holy <hi>Seraphims</hi> when they sung their <hi>Sanctus (Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of Hosts; the whole</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Isa. VI. 2 3.</note>

<pb n="258" facs="tcp:40528:150"/> their feet, and flew</hi> onely with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining pair. Humility was their most active grace, even in the divine praise. And surely this ought to make many of us ashamed, if not of our confidence in singing, yet of somewhat else therein. The like exercise ought there to be of the mind (2.) In divine love, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of him, whom we praise. For though all his acts are wonderful, yet his goodness to mankind has outdone all that ever else he did, I had almost said, all he can do. In redeeming us, as he has done, he has most transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently<note place="margin">Isa. IX. 6.</note> got to himself the <hi>name, Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> And (3.) in gratitude, or an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Zeal and study to express before men and Angels (seeing we are not able to make any appearance of recompence) how much we owe, and ever must owe to the God of our praise. And, which is a consequent hereof (4.) in Heavenly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedness, or earnest desire to be in such an estate, wherein indefinently we shall do nothing but praise him, and praise him better than now we do or can. And, Lastly, for a close fit to such a symphony, in love and good
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:40528:150"/> will towards mankind. For this we find to have made up two straines of three in the Angelical Hymn; After <hi>Glory be to God,</hi> comes <hi>On Earth peace, &amp;, good will towards men.</hi> Those blessed spirits so exprest their praises, as at once not onely to publish to those of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind who heard them, that God was now <hi>reconciling the world to himself in Christ Jesus,</hi> but also, by the very form of speech, to signifie their desire that it should be so, and their rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing that it was so. Now that such sweet combination of Christian graces and good affections, is requisite to the making up the <hi>melody of the heart,</hi> there needs no other proof but the comparing St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words in his two Epistles: what to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> he terms <hi>singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord,</hi> to the <hi>Colossians</hi> he styles <hi>singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</hi> These therefore must be the same, and one onely an explication of the other.</p>
                     <p>Having taken this particular view of<note place="margin">Sect. 8.</note> the <hi>inward manner</hi> of <hi>singing,</hi> called by the Apostle, <hi>melody in the heart,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch,

IV. 22, 23.</note> to the Evangelical state, is a <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in spirit and in truth. Such the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seeketh to worship him,</hi> and indeed all others his soul abhors, and is weary of. First, we are to worship him, by giving up our selves to him. This is worshipping him in spirit, when the <hi>soul</hi> is devoted, and really <hi>consecrate</hi> to him. Then in every act of Worship, the soul is really to direct its intention to him, and thereby to draw near to him, and this is worshipping him in truth. Whatever comes short of this, is but pageantry, and a more gay af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front of God, any further than it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces hereto. I therefore again most
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:40528:152"/> earnestly conjure all who have, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have, any zeal for our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>service, that they be careful in this matter. Alas! may it not daily be upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to many, according to the very li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral truth, that they who officiate in the Divine Service, and the Service it self so officiated, are to them <hi>as a very Lovely song of one that has a pleasant</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ezek. xxxiiii 32.</note>
                        <hi>voice, and can play well on an instrument: for they hear their words, but they will not do them?</hi> Or rather worse, they <hi>hear not,</hi> or heed not the words, but listen onely to the Musick, and rest therein? Now can we think but that this is most abominable in the Eyes of God? Nay, is it not so in the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all serious men, and even of natural conscience it self? Besides, what a disturbance must holy indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on give to any good mans devotion, when he shall be diverted, and put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides his attention of Worship, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding men, that pretend to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of God, tyed fast by the ears, staring, gaping, anon smiling, whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering, busie with every one neer them, unable to conceal the secret ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillation
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:40528:152"/> with which their curiosity, in attending Musick while they neglect the matter, strikes and affects them. If this be singing with the spirit, with art and skill, I am sure it is not singing <hi>in the spirit and in truth:</hi> it would not become a formal Jew, much less a Christian; it cannot be accounted sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>unto God,</hi> but to our own sensuali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Neither our Church, nor any of her genuine Sons, own, or can excuse such practice, as arguing not onely a gross neglect or ignorance of the true and substantial Worship of God in those persons who are guilty of it, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them accessary to the perverting and hindering it in others, and in a word, bringing a reproach and infamy on our Communion and Worship.</p>
                     <p>Such incogitancy and wandring of thoughts, as common frailty, and the slipperiness and instability of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane soul occasion, may find with God, through his mercy in Christ, an easie pardon, where these lapses are not indulged, but repented of, and striven against; and both the Worship, and the Worshippers, be nevertheless
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:40528:153"/> accepted. But what we have taxed, being of a far different nature, and amounting to little less than a total a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual aversion of the soul from God, as to such particular Worship, can never pass for devotion or service of God: and being without excuse with man, will never before God find any acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance, but, contrariwise, will surely add to the <hi>treasure of wrath against the day of wrath▪ and revelation of the righteous judgment of God.</hi> And those whom the consideration hereof will not work to more serious temper and intention, the <hi>Lord have mercy on:</hi> but how they can expect mercy till they repent &amp; reform, they must pardon me, if I tell them in good earnest, I do not see.</p>

                     <p>Some learned men have, and it would seem not unfitly, made a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction betwixt <hi>Ecclesia Prima,</hi> and <hi>Ecclesia Primitiva,</hi> betwixt the First Church, and the Primitive Church. Let it be so; notwithstanding I am sure even in the very <hi>first</hi> Christian Church, singing praise unto God, was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant part of their divine Worship at all their solemn Assemblies. This indeed we have seen already proved. <hi>When you come together, every one of you hath a Psalm, hath a Doctrine, &amp;c.</hi> Singing to God was no less frequent, than Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Preaching. And this we have seen to have been one reason of the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of those miraculous gifts, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Gift of <hi>singing</hi> insisted on in the foregoing Chapter, that the Church might not in its very beginning, be either destitute of Hymns proper t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>site to enquire <hi>What they sung.</hi> And touching this point, there are three co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>clusions which may be laid down, and which I conceive may prove satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
                     <p>First, Those who were indued with the spiritual Gift before-described, did undoubtedly in publick exercise the same, and that as well by inditing anew Hymns to God and Christ by virtue thereof, as by singing the Hymns so indited. The <hi>first</hi> Church then sung
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:40528:157"/> many times new <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nspired Hymns, pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to that their state: and hereof no one can doubt, who has considered the purport of the toregoing Chapter.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, We cannot well presume, but that some passages of these inspired Hymns were preserved, if not in some early-written Records (though not now extant) yet in the memories of such, who (like <hi>Janus</hi>) saw both backward and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, something of the inspired, and something of the more ordinary age of the Church. The reasonableness of this conjecture or supposeal, will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from what I have spoken in the first discourse, in the beginning of the fourth Chapter. Now this being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, it may be said, that in the Primitive Church there were several Christian Hymns composed by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of the earliest age, after the ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of the miraculous Gifts, partly out of such passages as were remembred to have been used by inspired men, and partly of such additaments, as they according to their Christian discretion thought sit to make thereto, proper to their then present state. Hereof though very
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:40528:157"/> little be come to us, yet that some of the Eucharistical part in the Office of the Communion may be of this Origin, <hi>I</hi> have above proved in the place just now named. And the same may I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude touching that Doxology, so usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in our Liturgy (<hi>Glory be to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost.</hi>) for in the same Dialogue, we now mentioned, it is plainly upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Lucian. Philop.</note> to the Christians of that time (<hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Trajan</hi>'s age) that they did, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <q>beginning with the Prayer <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and to it an Hymn with many names in it;</q> which cannot reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be understood of any Hymn else, there being none other, which comes under this character, that can pretend to be in any measure of such antiquity.</p>
                     <p>However, Thirdly, that there were two sorts of Hymns usually sung in the Primitive Church, is clear out of <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi>

                        <q>Sometimes we sing passages out of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, sometimes Hymns of humane
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:40528:158"/> posure.</q> And as to the later of these; those Hymns, sometimes were such as had been received, and for some space used in the Church, sometimes of new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er date. This, the very words of <hi>Tertullian</hi> now cited, <hi>De proprio ingenio,</hi> and that passage formerly alledged on another occasion, touching <hi>Paulus Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosatenus,</hi>
                        <q>that he took away the Psalms and Hymns, which had been used to be sung in the Church to the praise of God and Christ, pretending them to be new, and composed by men of later times, abundantly prove.</q> But it is evident, the Hymns thus reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Paulus</hi> were neither new, for that <hi>decantari solebant,</hi> they were used to be sung (&amp; this was about the middle of the 3<seg rend="sup">d</seg> century) nor that there was any culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble matter contained in them, for the Council censured <hi>Paulus,</hi> and restored them. So that we may without doubt conclude. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>he Primitive Church sung Hymns which were neither meer Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, nor otherwise of divine inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>One thing onely is to be added here, that though there were certainly in
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:40528:158"/> those dayes diverse Hymns sung, which were composed by more private spirits, yet none generally were of publick use, till they had at least passed the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the Bishops of those Churches, where they were used. This is in part proved already, and will hereafter come under further consideration.</p>
                     <p>Now as to the Primitive manner of<note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note>
                        <hi>singing</hi> all Hymns, it is certain it was very plain. Thus much is suggested by that passage above mentioned out of <hi>Pliny,</hi> where the Christians singing is called <hi>Carmen dicere,</hi> the saying an Hymn to Christ: and it is both generally agreed, and considering the condition of the Christian Church, it could not be otherwise. For what of state, or Musical graces, could be expected, while in stead of their harps, they were to bear their cross? while <hi>they wandred up and down in sheep skins,</hi> and in <hi>goat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skins, being destitute, afflicted and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented;</hi> while deserts were their cities, and caves their Oratories, and Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night one great canonical hour. And yet I must confess indeed, the plain way of singing, seems not to have been onely
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:40528:159"/> matter of necessity to them, but of choice also. Thus Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> hath recorded his information. <hi>De</hi>

                        </q> And one would think, that the Commentatour had fully hit the sense of the Text: But hear what <hi>Balsamon</hi> a great Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist, and no less than Patriarch of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och,</hi> saith on the same; <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>) begin the divine Hymns—nor sing any thing besides what was writ in the Church-books.</q> So that according to this Authour, the Canon provides not onely against a rude, irregular manner of singing, but also against introducing unallowed Hymns: and as to the later chiefly, if his comment give its true sense. However, that hereby a more orderly course of singing was designed,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:40528:168"/> cannot be denied, there being another Canon of this Council (namely, the last but one) which is directly intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against singing strange &amp; uncanoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Psalms or hymns; &amp; we may not think the Fathers in the <hi>LIX.</hi> Canon did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the <hi>XV,</hi> and meerly tautologize. This therefore we may take to have been one step towards more regular and artificial singing.</p>
                     <p>Having now heard of <hi>Canonical</hi> sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, it will be expedient to consider, what kind of persons these were, and how they were made so; for that this possibly may give us some further light into the point in hand. Whereas there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Zonaras</hi> plainly calls them ordained persons, and both he and <hi>Balsamon</hi> reck<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n them as being of the Clergy, it would seem, that some of the meaner of the Clergy were in those dayes parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly appointed to this Office: but we must know, it is not necessary, that they be ordained persons, or properly of the Clergy, who shall be reckoned Canonical singers. Amongst all the Orders of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, the <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> or Psalmist is none: And it is, saith
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:40528:168"/>

And if it be so with them now, much more was it so in those plainer and more simple ages. It is therefore observable, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non gives them not that style: so that I conceive the Canonists to have called them Clerks, onely at large, or in an improper sense, and in favour of them; and that in the same acceptation (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably) <hi>Zonaras</hi> his <gap reason="foreign">

But am not concerned to justifie in strictness every <hi>Glossators</hi> terms: Let the Psalmists, or Singers, be ordained persons for that time, and in those Churches, or not; it is certain, in the <hi>Western</hi> Church, and since, they have not necessarily been so: though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="296" facs="tcp:40528:169"/> have been ordered, and in some Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrals is) in more liberal arts, than one. To the point in hand: From about this time, the name <hi>Singers,</hi> as noting a particular Office, becomes fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in our Ecclesiastical Writers: Now except we will make these <hi>Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal singers</hi> no more than plain <hi>Readers</hi> (as truly to me seems unreasonable we should, seeing that <hi>Scripturas legere &amp; Psalm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And this not being to be had without mens addicting themselves thereto, and something of exercise and institution, we must conclude, that in the end of the third, and so more in the fourth century, some kind of arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial singing grew in request, and was both studied and practised: and that such Christian persons who were best Proficients therein, and could with most readiness, gravity, grace and clearness (<hi>Praecinere</hi> and <hi>praeire verba</hi>)
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:40528:169"/> sing the Psalms and Canonical Hymns before the people, and set all in, were appointed peculiarly to this Office; to the end, that the people might take, as out of their mouths, and after them, what they were to sing, and withall might be kept in some tolerable consent and harmony. And this, if we do not admit, considering the Christian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty could not have all the Psalms and Canonical Hymns without-book, considering also they were not then ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally book-learned, and had not that plenty or frequency of books and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, which we have, for them to sing thereout, it cannot be conceived how the whole Assembly should vocally join in such publick Offices, which yet it is evident, and in a manner general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreed, they did.</p>

With such calmness and Christian prudence our Church proceeding, did not find her self concerned, to melt her Organ-Pipes into Bullets, to purge Liturgies and Anthems by fire, &amp; to <hi>destroy</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrals, those glorious <hi>Houses of God in the Land;</hi> it being much more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to reduce to due order, than to abolish and pervert, what was well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed, and there being no footsteps of such Christianity in the Primitive ages, where there was more temptation to tumultuous practices.

                     <p>As to Forreign Reformed Churches, it having pleased God to plant them, where they are either more obnoxious

                     <p>As to <hi>Calvin,</hi> he seems not to have been constant to himself in this matter; at least, not to have spoken with such perspicuity, or memory of what he said on different occasions, and at sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times, as that it is easie to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile him with himself. We have said in his comments on the <hi>I.</hi> to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> he prosesses, he doubted not at all but the Christians, from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beginning, imitated the <hi>Jewish</hi> cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome in singing Psalms: now it is sure enough, the <hi>Jewes</hi> sung Psalms to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments. But it will be said for him,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:40528:180"/> he is to be understood there of the things sung, or of singing absolutely, and in the general, not of so strict a manner of singing. Be it so: yet in his comment on the <hi>Colossians,</hi> chap. <hi>III.</hi> v. 16, he allows it properly to be the nature of a <hi>Psalm,</hi> that in the singing thereof (<hi>adhibetur musicum aliquod in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentum praeter linguam</hi>) <q>some mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical instrument be joined to the voice:</q> from whence it plainly follows, that if Christians ought to sing Psalms, as he allows, and the Text enforces, they are then to use therein musical instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: And in his comment on <hi>Amos,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ad cap. 6. 5.</note> he highly commends <hi>David,</hi>

One might now expect, <hi>Calvin</hi> should have set up Organs at <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva:</hi> at least, that he should have reckoned the want of them amongst some other things, which he was not able there to redress, and which he did (<hi>ferre, quia non utile est contendere</hi>)<note place="margin">Epist. 3 3.</note>

<pb n="324" facs="tcp:40528:183"/> of the Bishops of those Churches, where they were used. The <hi>manner</hi> and circumstances of singing too have been various: The first singing, was in a manner nothing but a <hi>modulate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation,</hi> so that all sorts publickly and vocally joined as to some parts therein. Nor did the Christian people then content themselves with the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> practice, but at home and abroad, <hi>every where</hi> and upon all occasions and opportunities, all conditions and ages were employed therein.

                     <p>HAving now the Practice of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive<note place="margin">Sect. 1.</note> Church, and of succeeding ages, before us, it follows according to what in the beginning was propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we proceed more narrowly to view our <hi>Own,</hi> and to examine whether it be <hi>justifiable,</hi> according to the <hi>Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal rules,</hi> and <hi>primitive</hi> or <hi>laudable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents.</hi> Now it is obvious to any mans
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:40528:184"/> observation, that there is at present practiced in our Church a double use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in singing: And I must ingenuously acknowledge, no two things which have the same name, and in any degree the same nature, common to them, can be more unlike one the other, than are our <hi>Choral</hi> and <hi>Parochial</hi> singing. And even in our most regular Quires, there are two different sorts of singing admitted, the <hi>Gregorian</hi> way or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Chants, and that more curious <hi>Figurate</hi> kind, in which our Services (as we call them) our Anthems, and some other parts of our Liturgy, are composed. Neither of these two last, according as generally used, can be challenged, as not being sufficiently Harmonious: and if in the later of them, the intemperate skill of some Masters have introduced too much curiosity and delicacy, as to point of composition, the fault is onely by excess of sweetness; of which hereafter. The Parochial way is indeed obnoxious in diverse regards, but of that also in its proper place. In the mean time, we begin with the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Choral use, that b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:40528:185"/> much the more worthy to take place, and having more authority from the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Law.</p>
                     <p>And first as to the matter, it is to be<note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note> considered, whether what is according to law, or common custome sung, be in it self fit and meet. First, <hi>I</hi> do not account speaking or pronouncing in a Cathedral (that is a distinct, grave, plain audible tone) to be singing: for at that rate some might say (though with what reason, let themselves see) that we sing all. Now this being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, whatever is according to rule sung in our Quires, may be reduced to these heads, Psalms, Hymns, Creeds, or Prayers. That Psalms or Hymns in general are fit to be sung, cannot be denied; and for the particular Psalms sung with us, we shall suddenly, at large, consider them: and under Hymns at present, I comprehend Anthems. Of Creeds, we have two that are usually sung; the <hi>Athanasian,</hi> which is onely chanted or sung in the <hi>Gregorian</hi> way, on some more considerable Festivals; and that commonly called the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, which is curiously set by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:40528:185"/> hands, and constantly sung in the Communion-service. Now why any should deem it improper to confess our Faith in singing to God, I do not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. What more apt to draw forth the exercise of faith, hope, gratitude &amp; love, than the contemp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

We do without vanity profess, that in the singing our Creed, we exercise these several Christian graces, and at the saire time, both litt up our hearts to God in this our confession, and declare with joy before men and Angels, to the praise of our God, that we, from our hearts, receive these truths, and expect to be saved in the belief of them, blessing God, who has revealed them to us, and wrought in our souls a pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> this practice, I do not see. Some are of a mind, that the <hi>Carmen Christo tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam Deo,</hi> that <hi>Hymn</hi> which the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:40528:186"/> Christians used to sing <hi>to Christ as God</hi> in their early Assemblies, was their Creed, and the conjecture is not improbable. But touching the <hi>Nicene</hi> (though that we use is rather the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinopolitan</hi>) Creed, it is certain, it has been sung in the Church, in a manner, from the very compiling of it. <q>It was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained<note place="margin">In vita Marci.</note> (saith <hi>Platina</hi>) by this <hi>Mark</hi> (Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome,</hi> about the year 336. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Bellarmin</hi>) that on all solemn days, immediately after the Gospel (<hi>Symbolum à Clero &amp; populo magnâ voce decantaretur, eo modo quo fuerat in</hi> Niceno <hi>concilio declaratum</hi> the Creed should be sung with a loud voice by the Clergy &amp; people, in that form wherein it was explained in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council.</q> The same is said of him by <hi>Durantus</hi>

                     <p>It follows, that we speak something touching singing of Prayers; for that<note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> this some have prejudice against in our Church. Now they who will say it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to sing Prayers, must, if they will, stand to that assertion, lay aside the sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of most of the Psalms; for they are not onely, all over, full of Petitions, but some of them in their very Titles cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Prayers. <hi>Ps.

Now if the Church, to prevent all
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:40528:187"/> drawling and indecent tones (which are aptest too to fall in, in the closes of Sentences) hath brought in the use of such regular &amp; easie variation of accent, rather than singing, who shall cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <q>Truly (saith he) if singing be accommodated to that gravity, which becomes the sight of God and Angels, [and such we may safely say our sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is] it not onely gains much grace and veneration to holy performances, but is of very great force, to stir up mens minds, to real attention and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour in prayer.</q> In the judgment then of Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> (however his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent followers swerve from it) singing is so far from being unbecoming of the Office of prayer, that it is an help to its devouter performance.</p>
                     <pb n="335" facs="tcp:40528:188"/>
                     <p>But to come now more particularly to<note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> treat of singing the Book of Psalmes; which that we take intirely as they lye, by considerable portions in every dayes Worship, offends some, and is looked upon as a lip-labour, or a kind of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish task of Devotion. <hi>I</hi> do not say, but that some are apt to satisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the meer recital or chanting of them, that they go through the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly partitions as a task, and rest in the outward performance: we are sorry for it, and dayly endeavour to redress it, nor do we want success herein, blessed be God: But <hi>I</hi> do say, the number of them is very great, who are not thus sensless, who heed, and understand, and <hi>sing</hi> them <hi>with grace in their hearts;</hi> and that the practice it self is highly laudable, and of singular conducency to edification. Taking that therefore for granted, <hi>I</hi> shall onely shew, for the reconciling all sober spirits hereto, that the use it self is of far greater antiquity in the Church, than that it can be suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to be of Popish extraction: &amp; then, that though the Psalms were calculated chiefly for the <hi>Jewish</hi> state and worship,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:40528:189"/> yet they are not so improper for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian mens mouths, as many may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
                     <p>Some there are, who would fetch this practice as far as from the Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal age, and conceive those injunctions, that Christian people should <hi>speak to one another in Psalms, or Hymns,</hi> or in St. <hi>James</hi> his language, that they should <hi>sing Psalms,</hi> to be meant even of <hi>David</hi>'s Psalms. Nay, there are who go high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, even to our Lords own practice; &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he complained to his Father upon the Cross, in the words of the first verse of the two and twentieth Psalm, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude him then to have used the whole Psalm: And further, observing that after his institution and celebration of his Supper, he, with his disciples, sung an Hymn, judge them to have sung the <hi>Great Hallelujah,</hi> or the <hi>CXIV.</hi> and four following Psalms, which they say, the <hi>Jewes</hi> used to sing at the Pass-over. But these are onely conjectures: and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the lowest rank, are but bad ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. Such proofs do but little ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice (especially now adayes) which are as soon refuted, as denied. It is most
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:40528:189"/> certain the Hymns in those dayes were fitted to the present occasion by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, inspiring their authours: and though much use might be made of the Psalms, as consisting, more than other books of passages, fit for devotion and praise, yet it was onely of scattered parts of them, as they were seasonable; according as is evident by that prayer of the Apostles, <hi>Acts IV.</hi> 24, &amp; other like. To deal ingenuously then, the first instance, (as far as I know) which we have, savour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this practice, is the passage above cited, on other occasion, out of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi>

                     <p>First, the Eternal reason, that a publick sacrifice of praise should be paid unto God morning and evening. By these two periods and vicissitudes of times, it has pleased God to distinguish and measure out all time. <hi>The evening and the morning were the first day:</hi> and
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:40528:196"/> so the paying to God a solemn Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, or office of praise, at the returns of these is a worshipping him <hi>contin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Besides this, there was undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regard had to the particular obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriness of Christianity. The Christian Law may justly be esteemed to require, that its professours outdo the ancient <hi>Jewes</hi> in devotion, as well as sanctity. <hi>Except your righteousness exceed the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi>

                     <p>These reasons possibly may suffice, for the quantity of the Worship, and its frequent returns: but why should they have pitched on <hi>these psalmes</hi> to be sung rather, than any new Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Hymns? And why too on this <hi>alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate course?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As to the former, there may be two reasons assigned. First, it being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, that singing the Psalter was not set up in the Christian Church, till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the cessation of the miraculous gifts, there was nothing extant, fit to be sung, so little obnoxious to exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, as the Book of Psalms. Humane composures might be suspected, and, the Church being rent by Heresies, and one party jealous of another, even in their very Worship▪ undoubtedly were: but the psalms being confest by all, who own'd the name of Christian, to have been indited by the Holy Ghost, it might be thought, contention it self would be at a loss, to find a quarrel or plea against them. Secondly, I will not deny, but those dayes might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Apostolical commands of <hi>singing Psalms,</hi> and <hi>speaking to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:40528:197"/> in Psalms,</hi> literally of the book of Psalms. And though they were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in none of the exactest <hi>Logicians,</hi> yet may it not be gain-sayed, but they were serious honest Christians: nor is the variation great; St. <hi>Paul</hi> injoyns Psalms, they in prudence choose these.</p>
                     <p>And, as to the <hi>alternate</hi> singing them, that locution <hi>speaking to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> or betwixt one another, <hi>in psalms and Hymns</hi> appears favourable enough for it to any, who takes the first sense of words, that fairly offers it self: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when this singing by way of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternation, one part answering another, seems to have been the ancient way of singing in the Former Church. <hi>Exod. XV. 1. Moses &amp; the children of Israel sang this song unto the Lord, I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously, the horse and his rider hath he thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the sea.</hi> And ver. 21. <hi>Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand, and all the women after her: and Miriam answered them, sing ye to the Lord, for he hath triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed gloriously, &amp;c.</hi> This is yet clearer by that practice of the <hi>Essens</hi> (a Sect of
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:40528:197"/> the <hi>Jewes,</hi> which more approached to Christianity, than any other) record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Philo▪ Judaeus,</hi> and by him said to<note place="margin">De vit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templ.</note> have been taken up with respect to this singing of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Miriam.</hi>

Then they sing Hymns in the praise of God, composed in several sorts of Metre and Verse: some times jointly with one voice, sometime alternately.—And when with such sweet exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they have holily satisfied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they join all again into one Quire, in imitation of the like institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when the Sea, at Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, came together again for the destruction of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the <hi>Israelites, Moses</hi> lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the song to the men, &amp; <hi>Miriam</hi> to the women.</q> In these old precedents, the Church thought sit to alter some
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:40528:198"/> circumstances for more gravity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; yet so, as that she hath had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to ancient practice, singing some things alternately (especially <hi>Davids</hi> Psalms) and others by the whole Quire, all joining.</p>
                     <p>But touching the nature of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject<note place="margin">Sect. 6.</note> matter thus sung, there is one great difficulty still recurs. It will be said, the same Hymn is not proper for a Christians mouth, because pertinent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a <hi>Jew;</hi> nay, it is therefore impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: Nor can either the practice of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, or the commands of Bishops, or the sanctions of Councils, no, nor even well▪ meaning zeal and holy emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, justifie an impertinent form of Worship.</p>
                     <p>It might be answered hereto, and that soberly enough, that this practice having entred the Catholick Church by such methods, as above said, and having now the prescription of thirteen or four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred years, and the publick prudence and piety of our own Church, having thought good to continue and re-establish it by particular laws in our reformation, so that it is not in the
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:40528:198"/> power of particular objectors, to alter this the frame of the settled Worship, no modest and advised person ought, where the Question lyes onely touching the meetness and expediency of a thing, to oppose their private thoughts to the publick judgment and law; but rather submitting their own reasonings, to accommodate their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, as far as may be, to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick form, seeing they cannot model the publick form, to the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of their own devotion.</p>
                     <p>But I shall not at present desire any to exercise so much modesty or self-den<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>al, as to submit their reason to the law of the Church, meerly for the authority of the same. I onely request them a while to suspend their reasonings and objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to wave the prejudices they have conceived thence, so long as to consider, whether the Book of Psalms, if <hi>sung with understanding</hi> (as all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Hymns must be, otherwise they are impertinent, and unbecoming a Christian soul) may not be pertinent enough to the Evangelical state, and of excellent use in the publick dayly Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:40528:199"/> Now for the removal of this impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or suggestion of the incongruity of the Psa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ms to the constitution of the Gospel, I desire the particulars following may be considered.</p>
                     <p>First, that the Jewish and Christian Church are both in common, built on the same foundations; such as are the serious <hi>Belief</hi> and <hi>Worship of one,</hi> and him the onely <hi>living and true God,</hi> and of the <hi>same Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ias</hi> or Saviour of the World: onely the <hi>Jewes</hi> of old were to believe in Christ as <hi>Future,</hi> because then he was indeed to come, we Christians believe in him as <hi>come</hi> already, and as having <hi>suffered,</hi> and being now <hi>exalted</hi> to the <hi>right hand of the Majesty on high,</hi> because really he is so. Moreover, as to the <hi>Rule</hi> both of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Manners,</hi> we both receive the same divine Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the Old Testament; onely we Christians add thereto the New, but for the proof thereof, we neither have, nor pretend to have greater outward evidence than the Old: We have also for the main, the same Moral Law; onely Christ hath put a more advanced and refined sense on some things there▪
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:40528:199"/> therein. Hitherto then both the old faithful Jew, and present Christian agree; and therefore a service suited to the Foundations of either Religion (as were the Psalms certainly to those of the Jewish) must suit the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of both.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is considerable, that even in those points, wherein the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish and the Christian Church essentially d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ffer, as were for the main, the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward modes and institutions of their Worship, some temporal promises made to them, as objects of their particular Faith, and whatever else there is of the same nature, even in these points, I say, the Jewish Church was the type and image of the Christian. Their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Altars, Sacrifices and Priests, all, though in different regards, figures of our Lord Jesus our eternal Priest and propitiation, as is discoursed at large in the greatest part of the ten first cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters of the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> the very land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the rest which was promised to them, and of which they were once generally possest, a si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the Evangelical and Heavenly
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:40528:200"/> estate; Nay, their very Political laws, many of them, figurately or reductive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Christian. <hi>Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the Ox that treadeth out the corn,</hi> was said unto the Jew: that is to<note place="margin">1 Cor. IX. 9, 10.</note> the Christian, <hi>He that preacheth the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel should live of the Gospel.</hi> In fine, it may be said generally of all Gods deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with them, of the whole <hi>series</hi> and course of his providences to the whole Jewish state, under all its revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions and periods, from its very cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in <hi>Isaac,</hi> to its funeral in the last and fatal flames of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> what the Apostle saith of some particulars, <hi>They</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. X. 11.</note>
                        <hi>happened to them for examples, and were written for our admonition.</hi> Now the consequence of this consideration is plainly thus much, that forasmuch as in all typical and figurative speeches (with which, as is evident, the Psalms abound) there is a double sense, the literal and the interpretate, therefore (1.) if there at any time occur any pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in the Psalms, relating to the ceremonial Worship of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> the shadow being removed, and the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance taken, the literal sense looked
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:40528:200"/> through, and used as a perspective glass, and the signification, as the main object attended, this will be found truly Christian, and fit to employ Christian devotion. And the like may be said (2.) Of the Historical parts of the Book of Psalms: perhaps <hi>mutato no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, de te,</hi> apply the passages to thy self, and haply it concerns thee most intimately. Or if it be of more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and political nature, the <hi>Jewish</hi> state and people were the <hi>Type,</hi> the <hi>Christian</hi> the <hi>Antitype.</hi> Besides, we know God is not onely to be celebrated in the Assemblies of his people, for his late, present and private dealings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, or our own Countrey, but <hi>for his mighty works of ancient dayes,</hi> and all his marveilous loving kindness to the children of men.

And <hi>Ver.</hi> the <hi>last, Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Lord,</hi> which certainly is no unedifying, or contemptible kind of knowledge. Hereto may be added (3.) That forasmuch as the Prophesies extant in the Book of Psalms, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> have had their completion under and in the Gospel state, therefore if with the prophesie, we together consider the event (as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we ought) if we look on what was foretold, as now fulfilled, we have not onely reason, and most urgent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements, to admire the faithfulness, veracity and power of God, but convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing instances of his providence, of his infinite prescience and omniscience, who knoweth and speaketh of all things to come, as if he saw and described them present; for indeed all things are present to him: And further, we have fresh testimonies of God's greater mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and dignations unto us, than unto those his ancient people. They lived onely to hear those things promised; to
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:40528:201"/> us they have been all performed. Now certainly that which is apt, if sung with understanding and due attention, to wrap the devout soul into admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God's omniscience, truth, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, justice, mercy and loving kindness, not onely in general towards mankind, but particularly to the Christian Church, yea, to a mans own self, is not any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit matter to be sung in Christian As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies: but of this nature generally are the Psalms. It is plain then, that neither the <hi>Ceremonial,</hi> nor <hi>Historical,</hi> nor <hi>Prophetick</hi> parts of the book of Psalms, render them improper for the present publick use of Christian people in the praise of God. Nay, we see they are very proper to engage our hearts unto greater fervours of love and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude towards God, who sed the Old Church with promises, prophesies and types, but us with real performances and substance.</p>
                     <p>There remains then now no imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, or unsuitableness, imputable to the Psalms thus taken, because they were fitted principally to the Jewish constitution: And whatever exception,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:40528:202"/> touching their unmeetness, can be made against our present use of them, must be grounded on some other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect: perhaps on their being too peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accommodated to the particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the holy men their authours; sometimes importing such profound mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, into which the commonalty of Christians do not fall, or at least with which, few or none of the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are, while they sing, either affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted or threatned; sometimes again praising God for such mercies, which neither are of a publick nature, nor it may be have been received by one in ten thousand: again, at another time, expressing such vows and transports of devotion, which are not incident to common souls, and perhaps conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them in all circumstances, to few or none now adayes; And Lastly, on the other side, it may be, proceeding directly against the Christian law, by most bitter imprecations and curses a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Enemies, whereas we are all bound by our Christianity to love, bless and pray for our most merciless persecutors.</p>
                     <pb n="363" facs="tcp:40528:202"/>
                     <p>As to all which I say in general, that though all the particular passages in the Psalms, against which these exceptions are levelled, may not in the st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ict and literal expressions, in which they ly, be exactly apposite to the particular condition of many private men, nor haply to the common state of the Church, at the critical time of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent use of them, yet a moderate mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Christian discretion will remove these inconveniencies, and by a men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal application, and small variation of the sense (which in all publick Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Hymns, must be allowed to particular mens devotion, otherwise it is scarce possible any form, new or old, should in common suit all mens estates) bring them down either to their own, or others conditions, with good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, and according to the Christian Rule in such cases. And for evidence hereof, I desire the following points may be considered: and that the rather, because <hi>I</hi> judge they may not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the imputation we insist on, but also serve as directions, in the dayly use of the Psalms, for our singing with
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:40528:203"/> understanding and true devotion.</p>
                     <p>First then I say, it is a very gross mistake to think, that the faithful, in the publick Assemblies, are to mind onely their own concerns in the prayers and praises, which they offer up unto God. The <hi>Communion of Saints</hi> is part of an Article in our Creed: and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in can the scattered members of the Church, all the world over, hold communion more strictly and fervently with one another, than in their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and praises each for others, and all in general? The Apostle injoines not onely that <hi>prayers, and supplications,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. II: 1.</note>
                        <hi>and intercessions,</hi> but also, that <hi>Giving of thanks be made for all men:</hi> and our Lord taught us to pray <hi>Our Father,</hi> for the Christian community together with our selves. There is not one <hi>Me,</hi> but all along <hi>Ʋs</hi> in the Lords Prayer. Now that, which suits not with my conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may suit with the condition of some <hi>I</hi> know, or of thousands of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ones in the world, which <hi>I</hi> know not, and perhaps never shall know, till <hi>I</hi> see them in the Kingdom of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and so, if offered up in the behalf
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:40528:203"/> of such unknown Saints, whose condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions those Psalms fit, will neither be impertinent, or unbecoming a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, nor without a reward.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, there is nothing more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, than the condition of men on earth: That which is not my conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on today, may be nearer me than <hi>I</hi> am aware, both as to Spirituals and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals. St. <hi>Peter</hi> was zealously resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved over-night, rather to dy with his Master, than deny him; and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the day broke, he had denied him thrice, and curst, and swore upon it. Holy <hi>Job</hi> was one day a great Prince, swimming in plenty, blessed with chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, a man of great reputation and interest; but within a few dayes, a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable despicable <hi>Lazar</hi> upon a dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, neglected, forsaken, or depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of all, and as it would have seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of God too. Again on the other side, that which is not my condition now, possibly has been. Now in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of this variableness, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissitudes of humane things, it is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake to think, that we are to offer no prayers or praises even in our own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:40528:204"/> but such as strictly concern our present estate. Our Lord taught us to pray, not onely <hi>not to be led into tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation,</hi> but to be <hi>delivered from evil;</hi> to wit, from the evil of the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from being overcome by it, when led into it. It is certainly prudence, and a kind of Christian good Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, to put up prayers before-hand, which may operate in the changes of our condition: and accordingly our Church most wholesomly provides we should, not onely in the Psalmes but Litanies, <hi>In the hour of death, and in the day of judgment, Good Lord deliver us.</hi> Then as to matter of praise: Does any man think he is to bless God onely, for the mercies he is in that instant ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, or did but just now receive? Far be such ill memories from Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an gratitude! Our Royal prophet's Harp forgot not the woods and the cave, when it was tuned in a Palace and chair of State. The Petitions therefore and Thanksgivings, which suit not in strictness with my present state, may be pertinent and proper enough for my use, if applied unto
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:40528:204"/> what possibly may be, or I remember has been my condition: And surely, there is no man of a more unhappy memory in the world, than he who forgets what he has been.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it is to be considered, that as there cannot well befall us any such complicate distress in this life, but still we may perceive some blessings left, and therefore some cause to praise God, at least that it is not worse with us yet, so neither can we well imagine, such a complete union of all felicities on this side Heaven, which supposes not some Christian want; and so there will be still occasion for prayer, if to no other purpose, yet to this, that we may have grace not to abuse such heights of happiness: So that upon the whole, Prayer and Praise (of which two, the far greatest part of the Psalms is made up) let them concern what they well can, will never be unseason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and improper in our own, or in the Churches behalf; one or both, in one time or other, they must needs meet with.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, We are to remember,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:40528:205"/> that many of the Psalms were designed onely, or chiefly, as <hi>prophetical songs,</hi> touching our Lord <hi>Christ,</hi> and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>him immediately, either in his <hi>Humbled</hi> or <hi>Exalted</hi> estate. Such are Psalms <hi>II, XVI, XXII, XLV, CX,</hi> and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many more: now these, though they are neither all along pertinent to our own, nor the Churches present or future estate, are notwithstanding ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry far from being improper Hymns in Christian Assemblies. If our dear Lords sufferings, if his reproaches, scorns and smart, if his wounds and bloud, if his agonies, death and burial, may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in our dayly singing to him, then let us sing, let us live no longer. But if each particular of them, deserve at our hands ten thousand grateful recolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, praises and commemorations, and as many rivers of grateful tears, then let us not fear to sing to him, what he stuck not to undergo for us, the very <hi>afflictions</hi> and <hi>oppressions</hi> of his <hi>soul,</hi> when it was <hi>made an offering for sin.</hi> And if we are not to forget his <hi>Sorrows,</hi> why should we not also, though unworthy, sing his <hi>Glories?</hi>
                        <pb n="369" facs="tcp:40528:205"/> Our praises certainly ought to follow him, from his Cross to his Throne. The Royal Psalmist leads the Ditty, and<note place="margin">Psal. <hi>XXII.</hi>
                        </note> sings him sometimes even fainting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the malice of his Enemies, and in the very <hi>dust of death;</hi> and anon <hi>sat at</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ps. CX.</note>
                        <hi>God's right hand, till his enemies are made his foot-stool.</hi> Now these holy strains, though exceeding what is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to mortals state, are not yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent in the Christian Worship; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ay, they perfectly symbolize with the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive practice, they are (<hi>Carmen Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto</hi>) immediate Hymns to Christ.</p>
                     <p>By these four considerations it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that none of those Psalmes, or passages of psalms, which relate either to excessive and frequent miseries or mercies, if duly applied, can be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for Christian use in the Worship of God. To proceed then to another sort of Excesses.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, as to those complaints, vows, petitions, professions of love and zeal, and all other devotional parts, which import greater affection, fervour and transports, than what is commonly incident to most men in this
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:40528:206"/> the waining age of Christianity, that these are somewhat improper for us, is our own fault, and so great an one, as certainly needs redress. However, they may be pertinent to others: and tis not fit they should be struck out of the Publick Service, to lower it to some, or many mens dulness. Publick standing devotions, must be suited to all degrees of Christians, that mens graces, of whatsoever height, may have opportunities for their noblest eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. An humble soul can rejoice, that <hi>David</hi> and others have been thus affected, or have thus vowed, loved and professed, and will reproach it self for its own slackness and groveling state: withall, most easily turning such passages into prayers, that the like ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flames may be enkindled in its self, that it may not ever live a stranger to such raptures of good affection and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and studying that against the next return of these Psalms in course, its heart may be in tune for them, at least, able to take them in some tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable pitch. It cannot therefore justly be pleaded, that these parts of the
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:40528:206"/> Book of Psalms, are improper for the present constitution of Christianity.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, as to what remains, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny passages, and sometimes whole Psalms, are <hi>unsuitable</hi> to the <hi>Christian spirit,</hi> and not framed according to the Evangelical law, because contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imprecations, and very dismal cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses against Enemies, there is a double answer given by that great <hi>Exemplar</hi> of Learning and Godliness, Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Praef. to Annot. on the Psalms.</note> (1.) If those Psalms, or parcels of them, were rendred strictly according to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Text, they would not appear so much imprecatious, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciations of misery and destruction to such incorrigible enemies of God, his Church and people, whom nothing will stop in their malice but their own fall. And in favour of this interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is to be considered, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> was a prophet, and therefore a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitated and proper person to foretell or denounce such mens ruin, both for their own reformation, and for the support of the languishing Church. Further, it is most certain, that some of the Psalms, which are most
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:40528:207"/> obnoxious to this charge, were really prophesies, and are so applied by the Holy Ghost in the New Testament: Two or three of them particularly to <hi>Judas,</hi> as predictions of his character, fall and punishment. St. <hi>Peter, Acts I,</hi> 16, 17. alluding to that passage in <hi>Psalm XLI, 9. My familiar, who did eat of my bread, hath lift up his heel against me,</hi> applies it to <hi>Judas.</hi> So as to <hi>Psal. LXIX, 25, &amp;c.</hi> where we read, <hi>Let their habitation be desolate, and let none dwell in their tents;</hi> And proceeding in the same strain, ver. 28. <hi>Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous:</hi> All this by <hi>Acts I,</hi> 20. is plainly to be interpreted of <hi>Judas,</hi> and men of his stamp. In like manner also <hi>Ps. CIX, 8. Let his dayes be few, and let another take his Office,</hi> in the same place is referred to the same person. And if we read all these by the <hi>Futuretense,</hi> as they stand in the Original, thus, <hi>Their habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall be desolate, and none shall dwell in their tents. They shall be blotted out of the book of the living,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>His dayes shall be few,</hi> &amp; <hi>his office shall another take,</hi>
                        <pb n="373" facs="tcp:40528:207"/> (and not imperatively, as Translatours commonly render them) the case is clear. If then thus we take them, these passages are no wise imprecatory, but prophetical. (2.) We are to remember, what has been before said, that the Church and people of the <hi>Jewes</hi> were the image of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian: These things are a <hi>Figure.</hi> As the <hi>Jewes</hi> had enemies, with whom they were to make no league, nor so much as truce, but utterly to destroy them, so have we; to wit, our spiritual ones. Turn then all these Psalms against the enemies of thy soul, thine own lusts, the World and the Devil: Pray that thine heart, which they have too long usurped as their <hi>habitation,</hi> may be for ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after <hi>desolate</hi> of them, and that none of the same kind may ever enter that <hi>Tent.</hi> Thus taken, there can be no doubt of the propriety of these Psalms.</p>
                     <p>For further evidence, that even these kind of Psalms may be sung to edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Christian advantage, I shall produce the judgment, which a worthy and pious Divine (though no great friend to the Church of <hi>England</hi>) gives in the case, which haply with some men,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:40528:208"/> will goe farther, than many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of mine. Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly puts the case, <hi>How can we right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>

We may thence be built up in patience and comfort, against such temptations as are wont to arise from consideration of the prosperity of ungodly men, and the afflicted estate of Saints. (3.) We may also together pray God, that he would hasten his just judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (not against our own private enemies) but against the ungodly and incurable enemies of his Church.</q> Let these three Answers be put to the other two, and Christian practice be regulated accordingly, and we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver sing any imprecatory Psalms, but with happy advantage, and consistency with our Saviours precept, or the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical spirit.</p>
                     <pb n="375" facs="tcp:40528:208"/>
                     <p>But will some say, how are divine <hi>threats,</hi> or even <hi>promises</hi> themselves, with which the Book of Psalms is full, <hi>matter</hi> of divine <hi>praise,</hi> or fit to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy a Christian Assembly engaged in <hi>singing</hi> to God?</p>
                     <p>I answer (has God given precedents of this nature, indited by his own Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit) and by his providence orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his people should be inured to the practice of them, nay, and approved this practice, by declaring his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of it in Holy Writ, and shall man interpose, question, or controle what is so plainly authorised by the divine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure? The Song of <hi>Moses</hi> has frequent both promises and threats in it: &amp; as to the main body of it, is rather partly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensory, partly didactical, than any wise Eucharistical. The same must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged too, touching a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of the Book of Psalms. The very titles <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> &amp; such like, import, that this was not casual, or befel through any mistake or indiscretion of their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours; they were formally &amp; fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally designed to such purpose. And all this comports well with the Apostolical
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:40528:209"/> precept, <hi>Teaching and exhorting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Psalms, &amp;c.</hi> In a word, we must not be self will'd, conceited, singular and humoursome in our devotions: To <hi>frame our minds</hi> and affections to those <hi>divine forms,</hi> which God hath set us, is certainly an <hi>holy conformity.</hi> Is not God terrible in praises? Is he not glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rified, when men fear before him, when repeating and believing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciations of his wrath against sin, they tremble at his judgments, and be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing afraid at his displeasure, flee the cause of it (that is sin) as a deadly ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pent? Now what more proper to beget this temper (to imprint such a fear of God upon the heart, that it may not depart from him) than the use and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of divine threats? Again, can we give unto God greater glory, than that of Faith and Hope? <hi>Abraham,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>being strong in faith, gave glory to God, not staggering at his</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. IV. 20.</note>
                        <hi>promise.</hi> And what more proper to draw forth such Faith, than that the divine promises should dwell in our joyful lips, and be sung before God in his dayly praises. Besides, while we
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:40528:209"/> sing them thus with Faith, we plead them to God, and (as in the Titles of some Psalms, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> as if designed, <hi>To bring to remembrance</hi> even God's Word to himself) we become in a sort <hi>God's remembrancers,</hi> both in our own, and his Churches behalf. Can we well imagine a more profitable, a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable service?</p>
                     <p>I have thus reckoned up all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proprieties or impertinences, <hi>I</hi> could find, or devise, against the present use of singing <hi>David</hi>'s Psalms in our Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Assemblies. <hi>I</hi> have answered the imputations in their full force, and <hi>I</hi> trust <hi>I</hi> have shewn how such passages, or such Psalms, which are censured, or obnoxious to be censured, as most improper, may be of very heavenly use, if sung with understanding, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, faith, and due application. <hi>I</hi> hope then <hi>I</hi> may now leave the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent use of these Psalms, in the poss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of its authority, the sum of which is this: They were indited by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost for the use of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, which in its foundations was the same with the Christian, and in its
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:40528:210"/> very peculiarities a figure of it: The law of Nature requires, that the sing<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing praise unto God, should be one part of his publick solemn Worship; and the Christian law requires, that those, who undertake its profession, should exceed rather, than fall below the <hi>Jewish</hi> standard of devotion: <hi>Speak<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing to one another in Psalms, and Hymns, and spiritual Songs,</hi> indefinitely is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by the Apostle: <hi>Speaking</hi> or <hi>singing alternately,</hi> as it was an old use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, so seems there insinuated; and besides, it has been found serviceable mutually to quicken and excite the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocate affection of the parties sing<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing. Upon these inducements, Holy men, neer the eldest ages of Christia<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nity, thought good to introduce the singing these Psalms (as being undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>divine inspiration</hi>) and particularly this way of singing them: Ancient Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops &amp; Governors of the Church appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, set up and injoined the practice within their own Churches: Synods and Councils more generally establisht it by their Canons: It has now the prescription of thirteen or fourteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:40528:210"/> years in the Catholick Church: It is reinforced by the Laws of our own Church, and there is abundant reason for the continuance of it, from its par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular conduciveness (as we have seen) to all kinds, parts and degrees of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. Now those, whom this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count satisfies not, <hi>I</hi> fear will scarce be able to give so good an one, for any form of Worship, not set down in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press terms in the New Testament, and together there, by the same letter, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>
                     <p>After this large and particular discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion<note place="margin">Sect. 7.</note> of the reasonableness of singing <hi>David</hi>'s Psalms, I shall not judge it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to speak any thing touching our singing other Scripture-Hymns; the same plea much more suffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For I take an <hi>Anthem,</hi> to be nothing else, but an <hi>Hymn sung in parts.</hi> It differs from<note place="margin">Isidor: Orig. l. 5. c. 19: Rab: Maur: Inst: Cleric: l: 2: c: 51.</note> what we call <hi>Responsories</hi> (said to be found out by the <hi>Italians</hi> very ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) in that therein, according to the old use, <hi>Ʋnus Versum dicit,</hi> one sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Versicle (with us, in Plainest song) the Quire answers their part, either in the same way, or in more ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial Symphony; and that these are short, constant or continuing still the same: whereas the Anthem is much larger, of various and more solemn form, and has usually greater curiosity and diversity of parts. The parts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are fewer or more, according to the pleasure of the Composer: and sometimes single Voices, sometimes lesser <hi>Chorus</hi>'s, sing interchangeably and are answered by the <hi>Choru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> or full Quire. Even the subject matter, and the Form too is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent amongst us, not onely in diverse Churches, but even in the same Church; it seeming good to the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of those, who have power in this case, to frame, or direct the framing
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:40528:212"/> new Anthems, either suitable to some new emergent occasions, or for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Service of God more grateful and inviting to humane weakness, which is apt ever &amp; anon to be affecting something new. Now though the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity of the Musick in this case be (as we have said) a practice not of very many Ages, yet whatever else, as far as I see at present, there is herein, is of very ancient useage. We have seen St. <hi>Ambrose</hi>'s practice and institution above: He certainly both composed new Hymns of his own, and set up the singing of them in parts, as far as the state (and possibly the skill) of his people would admit: And whence he took his pattern, has also been spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. The <hi>Antiphons</hi> of the old Church, said to be first sound out by the <hi>Grecians</hi> (though haply the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est reason, which the <hi>Ritualists</hi> have to say so, is because the name is <hi>Greek,</hi> whereas the thing was an <hi>Hebrew</hi> use) were certainly but old fashioned An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thems. And those Ninety six Hymns, before-mentioned, in <hi>Breviaries, &amp;c.</hi> are nothing but Anthems, especially
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:40528:212"/> when sung in the Anthem-way. I know indeed, the present <hi>Antiphons</hi> in the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, are clear another<note place="margin">Duran: de rit; l. 3. c. 17 Gavan. in rubt. Brev. Sect. 5. c. 7.</note> thing. <hi>Ʋsu receptum est, ut sententia quae Psalmum aut Canticum praecedit,</hi> Antiphona <hi>dicatur.</hi> And as to their way of singing them. <hi>Inchoantur ab uno unius Chori, &amp; ad ejus Symphoniam cantatur Psalmus per duos Choros, ipsâ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>e Antiphonâ conjunguntur simul duo Chori.</hi> But that Church must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to have a singular art of introducing <hi>new practices</hi> at pleasure, and gloriously guilding them with <hi>old</hi> and venerable Names. Waving there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this innovated kind of <hi>Antiphous,</hi> I say, it has certainly been, from the very Primitive times, customary, and may now justly be accounted prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory, for the Fathers of the Church, Godly Bishops, to frame, or order the framing, Holy Hymns for publick use in the Service of God, as in their pious discretion and grave counsel, they shall judge fit: and these Hymns, if sung in parts, <hi>reciprocis &amp; alternanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus modulis,</hi> as now of long time the use has been in the Christian Church,
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:40528:213"/> are most naturally what is meant by the old appellation <hi>Antiphons;</hi> they are tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Anthymns</hi> (which though it be a newer name, more fitly expresses the thing spoken of) And this I take to be both the Original, and true nature, of our Anthems.</p>
                     <p>Having therefore so great Patronage for this practice, as to the general, in Antiquity, let us now consider what there is peculiar in our Churches use. As to the Musick of our Anthems, I have said enough already: as to their matter and form, these are the points, as yet very much untouched. And here I could wish, <hi>I</hi> could have found a Law for my guide, or could have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken some light from any publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, ever of force in this behalf: But whatsoever we have of a Sanction<note place="margin">Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick after the third Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, Morn. and Even.</note> relating to this matter, supposes An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thems as in use, and onely directs in what part of the Daily Office they shall succeed [In Quires, and in places where they sing, here followeth the Anthem] neither prescribing, nor so much as directing, of what materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and frame they shall consist. We
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:40528:213"/> must therefore have recourse to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice, and that at present, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, is this: The Masters of our Church-musick choose some short Psalm of Psalms, sometimes also portions out of any other Canonical Book of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture (according as best suits their Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical fancy) which they set to as curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Melodies, as they can; and this, thus composed, when they have try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and got practiced and performed by the Quire in private, they cause to be sung in the publick Service, in the place by Law prescribed for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them, and then 'tis a new Anthem.

                        </gap>ere onely more generally my design leads me to consider, what mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and form is most proper for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thems. And here I humbly beseech all, who shall please to give themselves the pains to read this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, and chiefly, with all dutifulness, my Superiours, that they will not interpret what I write beyond my intention, or as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the quality of my station, and
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:40528:214"/> as if I took upon me to advise, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe or dictate to those, from whom I ought to take Rules. I should with all submission entertain such Rules, were they given: but <hi>I</hi> neither know that the Church, or any the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours thereof, have determined or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected any thing in this case, and <hi>I</hi> am (as well as many others) too sensible, that there are great indecencies daily committed, and matters very unmeet introduced into the publick Lauds of the Church, by reason that our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>composers generally want that deep judgment in <hi>things sacred,</hi> which they have in <hi>sounds.</hi> Now the due design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and contriving the divine praise, being a duty of such moment, and this present point therein being, as far as I know, untouched by any, I trust I shall not deserve censure, if with all sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission I propose my thoughts herein, which possibly I may conceive my self several ways regularly enough obliged and authorised to do.</p>
                     <p>To the point then: <hi>I</hi> have said, I take an Anthem to be, in its true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, an Hymn: now it being of the
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:40528:214"/> essence of an Hymn, that it contain the praises of God, we may soon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude of what subject-matter our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thems strictly are to consist. Whatever most plainly, directly, and becoming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imports the praises of God, is most proper for an Anthem, and nothing else: now such passages of speech alone, immediately import the praise of God, in which we either design to <hi>speak wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily</hi> of him, or <hi>confess and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ow unto</hi> him; and most properly the former sort. Touching God, we can say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that we ought, but it must either concern his Nature, or his Works; what he is, or what he has done: and all, which he has done, relating ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to his Making, Conserving, or Governing the World, we are brought to this issue, that whatever words are primarily fit for an Anthem, must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther celebrate the infinite Majesty, Goodness, and Perfection of God, or else give him the glory of his Works o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Creation and Providence. And this later Head of Providence must not be strained too far, or to such remote matters, wherein we are generally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned:
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:40528:215"/> for by such means, the act of Worship, by us thus paid, will be less pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or our own; for that both our hearts are apt to be less affected with those things, which are far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning us, and besides, for those things, which do more neerly concern us, we more strictly owe express lauds, thanks and gratitude. Now of passages of this nature, we may in Scripture ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve three sorts. (1.) Some dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted immediately to God, by way of an actual address to his Majesty: such are those in the Psalms, <hi>O Lord our</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Psal. VIII.</note>
                        <hi>God, How excellent is thy Name in all the earth! Thou hast set up thy glory above the Heaven.</hi> And, <hi>O Lord, thou art very great, thou art cloathed with honour and majesty;</hi> with a thousand more: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n the New Testament, <hi>Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rev. IV. 11.</note>
                        <hi>and honour, and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are, and were created,</hi> and the like. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n others (2.) the speech is turned to our selves; and that either singly, by way of Soliloquy stirring up our selves to the praise of God; as,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:40528:215"/>
                        <hi>Awake up my glory, awake Lute and Harp,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Bless the Lord, O my soul, and all that is within me bless his Holy Name,</hi> &amp;c. Or, as supposed, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongst a community, either Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorically<note place="margin">Psal. CXLV. 3.</note> and plainly, as, <hi>Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised, &amp; his greatness is unsearchable:</hi> or Hortatorily &amp; Opta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, as, <hi>O come let us sing unto the Lord,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rev. VII. 12.</note>
                        <hi>let us heartily rejoice,</hi> &amp;c. And, <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and glory, and power, and might be unto our God for ever and ever, Amen.</hi> A third sort have the speech directed to other men, or other things, calling upon, and as it were conjuring, all spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to, to join mightily in the divine praise. Thus <hi>Psal. CV. O give thanks unto the Lord, call upon his Name, make known his deeds amongst the people. Sing unto him, sing Psalms unto him, talk ye of all his wondrous works:</hi> Like forms oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, in a manner, all over the Book of Psalms, especially in the four or five last. Now all such words as these, are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily fit for Anthems.</p>
                     <p>But will some say, Are no Anthems of more doleful and lamentable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents to be allowed? Is not grief, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:40528:216"/> and sorrow for sin, to be stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up thereby? I answer, though I do not conceive penitential Psalms to come under the name of Hymns, nor to be therefore very proper for An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thems (plain and simple modulation, and which savours more of compunction &amp; remorse, than curiosity of Musical Art, rather becoming them) yet such passages as are reducible to <hi>Confessions</hi> and <hi>Vows</hi> (the second member of the first propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded division) as they must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged meet enough for Anthems, so they are very pertinent &amp; proper to such purposes. Care onely here must be had, that such words be pitched on, which are most intimately proportionate to the Christian state, and which express such confessions and vows which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian men may be supposed both sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make, and through grace able to keep. And to this purpose it may be expedient, to pick here and there such portions, as are most suitable to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent circumstances, and not to take either one whole continued Psalm, or (without regard to the sense) such parcels onely as seem more apt to fall into Musical graces.</p>
                     <pb n="391" facs="tcp:40528:216"/>
                     <p>Now for my confining the subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matter of Anthems, within so narrow bounds (and especially, and most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, within the compass of the first member of the Division) I have seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reasons to produce, which whoso considers, haply will be of my mind.</p>
                     <p>First, This is most conformable to the Original pattern, whence Anthems ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther really were, or are pretended to have been taken; and that is, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels singing, as in parts, to God. In <hi>Isaiah</hi>'s Vision (whatever fabulous there is in that of <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s) it is certain the <hi>Seraphims cried one to another, Holy, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Holy is the Lord of Hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.</hi> And all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally who write touching the Origin of <hi>Antiphons,</hi> which were (proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly) the same in the Old Church, as Anthems are with us, affirm this to be the precedent, whence they derive. Now in all the Angelical Hymnes, or those of the blessed Saints in glory, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in Scripture, the contents are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly Laudatory; not excepting that (<hi>Luke II.</hi> 14.) which seems to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note something of a charitable intent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:40528:217"/> Mankind. Secondly, the most natural design of Anthems, which may be presumed, is to pay to God a more solemn, heavenly, and exalted act of Worship: and then, why should we not immediately sing <hi>Of</hi> him, or <hi>To</hi> him? Why should we go round about, and employ our souls onely upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine subjects at large, not coming at God in our thoughts, but onely indirect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; by the interposition &amp; consecution of many other considerations? Thirdly, The subjects specified, must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be most naturally proper for all Psalms, &amp; therefore most especially for those more choice ones, which we call Anthems. <hi>Is any merry,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>Let him sing Psalms.</hi> The<note place="margin">Jam. V.</note> most natural <hi>end</hi> of Psalms or <hi>singing,</hi> as to any effect on <hi>our selves,</hi> is <hi>Holy joy</hi> and <hi>gratitude:</hi> And then as to any other ends which either regard <hi>other men,</hi> or even <hi>God</hi> himself, whether we look on singing as destin'd to excite in others the <hi>like thankfulness,</hi> which we by singing express in our selves, or to pay to God a more <hi>cheerful</hi> and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn tribute of <hi>Praise,</hi> what is there,
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:40528:217"/> which more naturally comports with all these designs, than the consideration of God, his nature, excellence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, and all his works? Especially, where such consideration is, as occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on serves, intermixed with holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions and vows, as above supposed. It is true indeed, a multitude of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Psalms are of other argument; and we have proved even those fit to be sung: but that not so much in their own nature, as by reason of humane infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and for our own advantage, more than Gods glory. Thus the Psalmist in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited Prayers to be sung, but that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to quicken our dulness, and makeus more attentive, affectionate and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent therein: znd so too Doctrines of Faith and manners, as also threats, and promises (as the <hi>Druids</hi> did their Chronicles, and some old Nations, they say even their Pedigrees) to the intent the sweetness of singing drawing men to frequent repetition of them, they might more fully be learnt and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested, more faithfully retained in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, more deeply imprinted in the heart, and have due effect: And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:40528:218"/> in compliance with the Holy Ghosts design, we do daily sing such matters, in the course of singing <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Psalms. But when we shall be advanced above this state of imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though even then we shall sing still, yet shall we no more sing <hi>prayers,</hi> for we shall want n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>thing which we may ask; nor <hi>Doctrinals,</hi> for we shall be no longer to learn; nor <hi>Promises,</hi> for we shall be possest of all promised; much less <hi>threats,</hi> for we shall be past the need, as well as misery of terrours: but we shall sing Gods <hi>Excellencies</hi> and <hi>Works,</hi> we shall <hi>acknowledge</hi> our own vileness in order to advance his glory, as the Elders are represented <hi>casting their crowns before the throne;</hi> and if<note place="margin">Rev. IV.</note> we may not be conceived <hi>vowing,</hi> we shall (which is in effect the same) be incessantly exercising an habitual resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedness, to persevere in praising and loving God to Eternity. These there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must be esteemed the meetest sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for us to sing to God, because, by divine appointment, they are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent far the greatest part of what we sing, and hereafter will be solely, as far
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:40528:218"/> as we know, the total summe. To these reasons, though others might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with great facility, yet I shall judge enough said to justifie the resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion above given.</p>
                     <p>It remains, that it be now consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what Form is meetest for Anthems, abstracting from the subject-matter, namely, whether Prose or Verse. As to matter of present practice, it is sure our Anthems are mostly Prose: and the reason hereof, <hi>I</hi> conceive to be the cautioness of our Church-composers, who, lest the words of their Anthem should be excepted against, generally choose express passages of Scripture. In the mean time it cannot be denied, but that the Old Anthems, that is, the Hymns composed by the Old Fathers for publick use in the worship of God, and sung in way of Antiphons, were mostly verse of strict measures, as hath been sufficiently made out. In imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which pattern, <hi>I</hi> humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that in our Christian Hymns or Anthems, we are not, and ought not to be bound up to the express words of Scripture, and especially not of the
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:40528:219"/> Old Testament. A great part of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture in general, but especially all Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture poetry (as is the Book of Psalms, whence our Anthems are most common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken) is full of allusions and refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences to the <hi>Jewish</hi> Oeconomy, which though it be, as we have said, very useful when duly applied, yet to have the praises of God always conceived and sung in expressions, which concern Christianity onely at some distance, is not so meet: Besides, that there are many things writ in a kind of closer and more naked way, wanting in a Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation those ornaments which originally they had; so that to relax the style by a prudent paraphrase, would make all fitter for popular capacities, and more apt to move affections: especially, if put into Poetical form, which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally fitter for Musick, than Prose, and falls into it with more ravishing sweetness, where the Composer under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands the graces both of Musick and Poetry, and brings both happily to meet, and set off one the other. <hi>I</hi> will humbly give an instance: It is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sung in an Anthem, <hi>Praise him with
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:40528:219"/> the sound of the Trumpet</hi> (and then our Musicians dally with that word <hi>Trumpet,</hi> repeating it, for meer sake of the Notes, till it become nauseous) <hi>Praise him with the Psaltery and Harp.</hi> Suppose, in stead hereof, we were to sing, composed Musically, according to the grace of the Verse, and with such melodious interchanges of Parts and Voices, as the words naturally suggest, thus in a Paraphrase;</p>

And though those Texts of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appointed to be used on Easter day, in stead of the <hi>Invitatory,</hi> be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly called an Anthem, or Anthems,<note place="margin">Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick for Morn: Prayer.

Though there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have thus from the Church a precedent in each way (and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, both are by her adjudged meet) yet it seems to be the mind of the Church, that what Originally was
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:40528:220"/> Verse, should (at least, at discretion might) in our Anthems be Verse still. But of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry, in offices of Divine praise, more anon.</p>

It is remarkable, that instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Musick alone is there made use

But that passage of <hi>Elisha</hi> is yet more clear: Being consulted by <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi> a wicked King (who in time of<note place="margin">2.

<pb n="402" facs="tcp:40528:222"/> when the Minstrel played, that the hand of the Lord</hi> (the spirit of Prophesie) <hi>came upon him, and he said, Thus saith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <q>I intend, saith he, after the example of the prophets and ancient Fathers of the Church, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive for the common people, psalms in their mother-tongue, that is, spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual songs, that the word of God may dwell amongst the people, even in singing. I am therefore every where looking out for Poets: and seeing you have great command of, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance in, the <hi>German</hi> Tongue, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of your long use thereof, I desire you, that you would labour with me in this matter, and try to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late some of the psalms into Verse fit to be sung, as here you have an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and pattern of mine. Now I
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:40528:224"/> would have all new and courtlike ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions declined, to the end, that, according to the peoples capacity, most plain and usual, yet cleanly and fit words may be sung, and that the sense may be rendred clear, and yet as near as may be to the psalm. We must therefore here use freedom, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the sense, leave the words, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering them by other fit words: I have not so much grace of speech, as to be able to effect what I would in this kind: I therefore will try if you are an <hi>Heman,</hi> or an <hi>Asaph,</hi> or a <hi>Jeduthun.</hi>
                        </q> Thus <hi>Luther,</hi> whose endeavours and attempts in this case were, as we see, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Twenty years elder than <hi>Marot</hi>'s: but in imitation, as he sayes, of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> under the Old Testament, and of the Ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> under Christianity. Which, that it is true, namely, that the <hi>Ancient Fathers,</hi> as well as the Prophets, composed Hymns for the people in <hi>verse,</hi> and that the whole body of the people, as well as some select persons making up a Quire, used Vocally to join in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick singing such Hymns to God, we have had abundant evidences, and I
<pb n="705" facs="tcp:40528:225"/> think undeniable ones. To <hi>Luther</hi>'s judgment, that Verse was fittest for the peoples singing, <hi>I</hi> will add <hi>Peter Martyr</hi>'s, who treating of Church-mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick and singing to God, not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends <hi>Poesie</hi> (when used as it ought) but adds a singular commendation of it. By its very <hi>Original,</hi> he asserts it to<note place="margin">Loc: Com. Class: 3 Lor: 13 Sect. 25.</note> have been of <hi>sacred</hi> design. <q>The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, saith he, when they would either by common Votes pay God thanks, or impetrate any benefit from him, were wont to use certain solemn Verses or Poems.</q> And after instances given in several kinds, by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Nations, he proceeds, <hi>Cantus autem, et si per sese hominum animos ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect at, attamen cum illi Oratio subjici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, quae sit numerosa, &amp; pedibus qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busdam alligetur, &amp;c.</hi>
                        <q>Now singing, saith he, though singly and of it self it delight mens minds, yet when such speech is added thereto as consists of numbers, and is bound to certain feet, as we see Verses are, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes much more sweet: And such truly was the Original of Poetry: nor can <hi>I</hi> deny it to be a gift of God;
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:40528:225"/> but this <hi>I</hi> could wish, that amongst mankind it might be kept pure and chast.</q> He proceeds, setting forth how ancient and frequent the use of it was in the Jewish Church; and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reception and use thereof in the Christian, we have spoken already more abundantly.</p>
                     <p>The judgment of Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> in this case, may be concluded from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of <hi>Beza,</hi> of which partly account<note place="margin">Beza Tract. Theol. vol. 1. p. 654.</note> has been given already, and more might be said out of his own works: for that so considerable a practice, as the rendring or singing <hi>David's Psalms</hi> in <hi>metre,</hi> should be set up in his Church, without his approbation, no man that knows of what spirit he was, will ever imagine. Though therefore I cannot say, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any projected the putting <hi>David</hi>▪s Psalms particularly into <hi>metre,</hi> for the common people to sing, before <hi>Luther,</hi> yet that he did attempt it, and other of the Reformers proceeded by the same pattern, and therefore approved the practice, is evident; as also, that both the Antient <hi>Fathers,</hi> and the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers,</hi> did conceive <hi>verse fit</hi> for the
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:40528:226"/> publick and <hi>solemn praise</hi> of God, and the later, at least, <hi>prefer</hi> it.</p>
                     <p>The reasons hereof we may conceive to be (1.) The precedent, which the Holy Ghost gave in this case, inditing the praises of God in old Hebrew verse: which sacred Poems to render meerly word for word into the prose of the modern languages, may possibly seem to some not so much to <hi>translate,</hi> as to <hi>meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphose,</hi> and in the worse sense to <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce</hi> &amp; disguise them. Such stripping them of their <hi>native glories,</hi> and making one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their <hi>naked sense</hi> and <hi>inner substance English,</hi> or of any other like Tongue, while we allow that sense nothing at all of the <hi>graces</hi> of such Tongue, into which it is transplanted, for the <hi>adorning,</hi> or so much as it were <hi>skinning</hi> and <hi>colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it over,</hi> is only after a sort to make <hi>Skeletons</hi> of them, and naturalize those, not their goodly Original selves. <hi>To supply the lost excellencies of another lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi>

                        </gap>seate mens minds in this Heavenly exercise of <hi>singing</hi> to God.</p>
                     <p>This will be more apparent, if we consider the Ordinary method of using it. The <hi>Parish clerk</hi> (a person common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of as little judgment as most of the people, but of much more conceited<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and pertness) chooses any Psalm, that he has an humour for, that is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, any that first comes to hand, which he knows, and can fit a tune for: this he dictates out of the book, line by line, and the people sing it broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:40528:232"/> in such petite and imperfect shreds. Now herein are many mischiefes, of which the least is not the <hi>Clerks impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent choice:</hi> He oftentimes shall begin in a broken sentence, with a causal, or illative, or such like clause; where for want of what went before, the act of judgment, or the perception of the subject matter and sense, being mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably incomplete, such needs must be all their devotion, who sing. This evil is not seldom occasioned by the division of the Psalms into <hi>First</hi> and <hi>Second</hi> and <hi>Third Parts:</hi> For it must be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, those who modelled them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this frame, having regard onely to the strict quantity of four or five staves, which they thought neither too much nor too little to be sung at one time, indiscreetly made such lame partitions of them. That will be evident by any slight inspection into the book. To omit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent instances: the Eighteenth Psalm is divided into five parts; the second and fifth begin each with a copulative clause thus, <hi>And like,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And still like,</hi> &amp;c. The third with a discretive <hi>But e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore,</hi> &amp;c. And as if the mischief men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:40528:233"/> did not occur too frequently by this means, it having of later years been found too tedious to sing alwaies one of those whole partitions at a time, there is occasion of subdivisions, and those made at the pleasure of the Clerk; so that as things stand in most of our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish-Churches, 'tis three to one but these our publick Hymns to God, begin with imperfect sense. If we should e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape this rock, 'tis still as great odds, but the same persons imprudence drives us on another: A Psalm not proper e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to the Christian state, and which concerns not at all the divine praise, but some other particular remoter sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, shall be proclaimed to be <hi>sung to the praise and glory of God;</hi> and the abused Congregation shall <hi>in his praise</hi> sing <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion to their foes,</hi> that is, in effect ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, direful imprecations one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another.</p>
                     <p>But admit we have a more prudent Parish Clerk (which God forbid but in some places we should have) or that he is directed and over-ruled in this case by the Minister, yet the <hi>Giving of the Psalm</hi> (as we usually term it) occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:40528:233"/> the same loss or stumble to devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as before: the lines are so very short, and the sense of one so runs into the sense of the next, &amp; that it may be into a third, that we must stay many times till the people have sung two lines, and the Clerk has read three, or both more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can comprehend what is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of that sentence, the greatest part of which, notwithstanding we are sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to have already sung to God; now in so long a suspense of the mind, how it can possibly frame such distinct and pertinent thoughts, as in this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly act of Worship ought to employ it, let any person of reason judge.</p>
                     <p>After all, admit we could avoid each of the mentioned inconveniencies, yet the meer <hi>irregularities</hi> and discordant jarrings of the multitudes singing, in most places, so grates the ear, as that it is very difficult even for the best, the most prudent and charitable men, to be devoutly conversant in this so necessary and ravishing part of Gods service.

                     <p>The former of these <hi>I</hi> should not have thought necessary to have been asserted by any solemn proof (for it seems to me to have intrinsecal natural clearness enough in it self, to approve it self to every mans reason) but that it has been gainsayed by some persons of great piety and learning, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deservedly of great authority in all the Reformed Churches.

<pb n="428" facs="tcp:40528:235"/> has been affirmed by Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> as we have already seen, by <hi>Peter Martyr</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. in 1. ad Cor. 14</note> (whom yet we have found elsewhere commending expresly Church-musick, whatever he meant by the name) and diverse other moderns; &amp; indeed it seems insinuated by <hi>Aquinas</hi> himself in the place before-mentioned, &amp; an elder author. In answer whereunto, though it might seem sufficient to say, it is (<hi>Gratis dictum</hi>) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisterially said, without reason assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it, &amp; they who <hi>affirm'd</hi> it, or do <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm</hi> it, by all <hi>law</hi> ought to <hi>prove</hi> (which I do not see to be possible in this case, nor have yet found fairly attempted) yet I shall propose such evidences, as may as fully evince the contrary, as a <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> can well be proved.</p>
                     <p>Onely it will be necessary (in order to the making our way plainer) to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise that all circumstances of Worship, or modes and <hi>Ceremonies used</hi> by the <hi>Jewes,</hi> were <hi>not purely Jewish</hi> &amp; <hi>legal</hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> but some of <hi>natural</hi> right, and fit to all states of the Church. The <hi>Jewes,</hi> for instance, used to pray <hi>kneeling,</hi> and <hi>lifting up their hands,</hi> and most times <hi>eyes;</hi> which postures, though evidently but
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:40528:235"/> ceremonies and circumstances of prayer, yet he, who will say they are <hi>Judaical</hi> and unfit for Christian Worship, because used by the Jewes, must condemn not onely St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the whole Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church ever from the beginning, but even our Lord Christ himself. In like manner, the Jewes used to <hi>fast,</hi> which is but an appendage of divine Worship, yet is not fasting therefore peculiar to the ceremonial, but also proper for the Christian people. The same may be said of their <hi>Weekly Sabbath,</hi> plainly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted to be ceremonial (<hi>Col.</hi> 11. 16.) which yet we do not doubt to copy in our Lords day. It were endless to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon up all instances that might be alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of this nature: The result then, in a word, is. That these modes and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages of Worship, which genuine reason and natural fitness dictated to the Jewes, are not to be esteemed purely Jewish ceremonies, or belonging to the legal Paedagogy, but (<hi>caeteris paribus</hi>) fit for all ages of the Church. And of this nature do I contend, the use of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental</hi> Musick in the Worship of God amongst them to have been: And
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:40528:236"/> for proof hereof I say,</p>
                     <p>First, it is of the essence of a <hi>Jewish</hi> or <hi>legal ceremony,</hi> that it be <hi>significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> or a <hi>Type</hi> of somewhat to come to pass, or to be done, under Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: And those things, which have an intrinsecal aptness and efficacy to excite devotion, may not be accounted Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish ceremonies, but natural and (as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion serves) standing helps of divine Worship. Now if any will affirm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental Musick to have been purely legal and ceremonial, what will he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign in Christianity, as the substance of this shadow? Will he take up <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> his forc't allegories in this case, and say? The <hi>Decachordum</hi> or<note place="margin">Paedag, l. 2. c. 4.</note> instrument with ten strings, signifies the name <hi>Jesus,</hi> because the first letter of it Originally stands for <hi>Ten.</hi> And that the <hi>Psaltery</hi> denotes the <hi>Humane tongue,</hi> and the <hi>Harp</hi> the <hi>Humane mouth,</hi> which is moved by the spirit of God, as the Harp is struck by the hand. These things will not pass now, though they seem'd<note place="margin">Vid.

<pb n="431" facs="tcp:40528:236"/> that not even <hi>Clement</hi> himself disallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>instrumental Musick</hi> in the praise of God.) Or, as to the other point, if any will deny the <hi>natural aptness</hi> of such Musick to calm inordinate affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to beget a divine temper, to draw forth the mind in love of God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of pure and heavenly goods, to lift it up above earth, and, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, above it self, how will he answer the experience and consenting suffrages of Mankind.

                     <p>Fourthly, The ceremonial Law was given onely to the Jewes, to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by them till the coming of the Messiah: But not onely Jewes but Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, all peoples and Nations, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and wheresoever, all mankind are called upon, and required to celebrate
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:40528:244"/> the praises of God, with singing and all manner of musick, and that for the salvation wrought by the Messias, our Lord Christ Jesus. Hereof though di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse evidences might be given out of the Psalms, yet none more full and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory (that <hi>I</hi> know of) than what the <hi>XCVIII.</hi> affords, that being a Psalm undoubtedly designed by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Prophesie, in praise of God, for the redemption of mankind and publication of the Gospel, to which, particularly, the second and third ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of that Psalm are four times expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applied by the Holy Ghost, namely,<note place="margin">Luke I. 54, 72. &amp; Ch.

                     <p>Lastly, Where can any shew us that passage, either from our Lords mouth, or from the Apostles hand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, which declares, or so much as insinuates this
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:40528:245"/> institution to have been legal and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial, or abrogate? Or is it any where in the Old Testament intimated, that it was to be but Temporary?</p>
                     <p>In summe then, and to bring the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence given as closely as may be to our cause, and together to the obviating our adversaries suggestions: It is plain, <hi>instrumental musick</hi> in the worship of God was of divine institution, and is expresly called a <hi>commandment of God;</hi> therefore it cannot be in it self unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or what some may mean by <hi>Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worship:</hi> most passionate exhortations at least, if not commands, to this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, are directed to all mankind, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles as well as Jewes; therefore it is not purely <hi>Judaical:</hi> and evident it is, the reason of this institution was not such, as of the ceremonies, no signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficativeness of Christian mysteries, but the natural efficacy of the thing to raise devotion, and its fitness to <hi>make the praise of God glorious,</hi> brought it in; therefore the reasons of the Law conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing, it is very unreasonable to say, the Law was temporary, except either at the making of this Law, it had been
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:40528:246"/> declared such, or some subsequent pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, or Evangelical precept, had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null'd it, none of which can be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. And to say it was abrogated in the Gross, as being part of the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Law (which all acknowledge ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate by the Gospel) is still as unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, seeing it is neither part of it, as being of later date many centuries of years, nor a kin to it, as being not at all <hi>Typical,</hi> but of natural <hi>usefulness</hi> and <hi>decency,</hi> becoming the service of God, and helpful to us therein. <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental musick</hi> in the worship of God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>It remains now, that we examine<note place="margin">Sect. 13.</note> the <hi>expediency</hi> of the practice we plead for: for, according to our great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, many things may be <hi>lawful,</hi> which

                     <p>Why any should doubt, whether it be <hi>expedient under the Reformation,</hi> I can guess at nothing else as a reason, but the common infirmity of Humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which, through abhorrency of one Evil, too frequently runs into the contrary Extreme. There is indeed great abuse of <hi>Church-musick</hi> in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Church. Gross and intolerable enough it had been, that all their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick service should be in <hi>Latin,</hi> and so by the very language commonly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the people: But that this
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:40528:248"/>
                        <hi>Latin</hi> too should be so disguised by their musick, and way of singing, that even the Learned themselves, except well skilled in the daily Offices (a matter of no small difficulty) and able to turn their books (which, if I mistake not my self, the meer Laicks seldom have) and, besides this finally, keeping their eyes almost constantly upon them, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly understand any considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of what is sung, or so much as in their minds go along distinctly, and join with the Quire (this I say) leaves them no excuse, and renders their publick worship meer Pageantry; both learned and unlearned (at least of the Laity) are unprofitable. Nor do we find their leaders at all concerned at this mischief: they are so far from designing their peoples understanding (in the publick worship I mean) that they plainly contend it not to be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, and indeed may seem to have contrived all wayes imaginable to blind them. Hence it comes to pass, that in a manner, all Religion amongst them is placed in the performance of certain external acts (commonly thus or thus
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:40528:248"/> frequently, or to such a number) and their people bred to believe, their meer having heard a <hi>Mass,</hi> or some such like office (of which they scarce understand a word) to be a principal service of God. Now, because it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be a dull and tedious employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for men to be held by the ears, an hour or two, with words, the sense whereof they are ignorant of, it was therefore contrived in order to making the people swallow so unpleasing and sensless a worship, that all delicacy of Musick and Singing should be used in far the greatest part of their publick Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, whether the subject matter of them were fit to be sung, or not. So that upon the whole, the use of Musick among those people, in their publick worship, is onely to <hi>amuse</hi> the <hi>minds</hi> of the <hi>weaker,</hi> and <hi>entertain</hi> the <hi>senses</hi> of the more <hi>delicate</hi> sort: 'Tis a relish hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <q>Simple singing is not a thing which is agreeable purely to them, who are children, but singing with sensless instruments, with dancing and with Timbrels. Wherefore in our Assemblies, the use of singing with such instruments, and other Rites befitting children, is taken away,</q> and simple singing onely left, and then he runs on in a long praise of the virtues of Church-singing. Now it is considerable, that in this censure,
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:40528:255"/> we meet with instrumental musick in company with the Jewish custome of Dancing with jingling or rattling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments in their hands, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists not with that gravity and decency, which we both plead for, and practice in our Church-musick; so that it is not simply our practice, but somewhat more, which is here condemn'd, and which we our selves should have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, if any where in use in the Christian Church. But it will be said, he condemns instruments in general, as being part of those childish rudiments, and tells us onely, simple singing was then in use. He does so, and speaks herein his own judgment, and as we have confest the practice of those times: Of that practice, the reason we have already seen, and find not our cause at all prejudiced thereby; and of what importance his judgment is, let us now confider: First, the Authour, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, was not <hi>Justin</hi> the <hi>Philosopher</hi> and <hi>Martyr:</hi> for, he cites <hi>Origen,</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and calls the later of them a Martyr; whereas, it is certain by <hi>

That person must have better eyes than I have, &amp; have consulted more than Three Editions of <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> who can find any such thing there.

                        <q>These instruments were then

For God considering their sordidness, and sloth, and groveling nature, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by this means to awaken them, mixing with the labour of attendance, the pleasingness of Melody.</q> Against this Text of the Father, we have no exception to make, but onely what has been already insinauted, and for which, diverse express Testimonies of Scripture have been alledged, namely, that this Musick was not meerly <hi>permitted</hi> or <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,</hi> but by prescript order <hi>comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;</hi> and that though the command was delivered by <hi>David,</hi> &amp; the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Prophets to the Nation of the Jewes, yet it is obligatory still (at least by way of direction to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church) in like state of
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:40528:258"/> affairs through all ages and peoples, because the reasons hereof are not tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, but likely to last as long as the world: and as to that part, we need onely to appeal to the reasons here as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed by the Father. We acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God, in this institution, regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded humane <hi>infirmity,</hi> and designed the <hi>raising</hi> our souls, and making us in love with devotion and diligence therein, nor did we ever pretend o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise.</p>
                     <p>And now, what has the appeal to the judgment of the antient Fathers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged our adversaries, or lost us? That passage of an uncertain authour, which was most against us, comes not purely home to the point; and besides, his judgment, in the confession of our adversaries, is but very mean, and the writing certainly spurious. That pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> (as falsly repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as cited by them) we no further dissent from, than as he manifestly abates the express term of Scripture, otherwise he makes for us. The testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies on the affirmative side, are most closely pertinent, subject to no ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:40528:258"/> and undoubtedly authentique. Others may add more, but this is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to shew, Primitive antiquity disallowed not our practice, though the state of the Church then admitted it not.</p>
                     <p>Neither will the state of the Church now admit it (will some say) if you regard spirituals, and the <hi>scandal</hi> it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministers to the <hi>weak multitude.</hi>

                     <p>To speak freely my sense to this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, I cannot but believe there are many persons, who pretend daily to be scandalized, that are not concerned in conscience what they pretend or say, nay, that understand not what scandal means. The pretence of scandal, as it is used, seems to be an Objection, when all others fail, against whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver men have a mind to opp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> what scandal is, and we shall find the pretence of it (though indeed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly unreasonable in most cases, yet) most vilely unjust in this. It is very
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:40528:259"/> plain by the Apostles discourse in 1 <hi>Cor▪ VIII,</hi> that to administer matter of <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Now in the present case, besides that it is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable for a generation of knowing men (as would seem at least) bred up in a Church, which has enjoyed the Gospel, powerfully preached in its purity, for above an hundred years in continuance, besides, I say, that it is very unseasonable for such people, in such circumstances, to pretend scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal and weakness, with what truth can any say, considering the present practice of our Church, that they are scandalized at our Church-musick? That others, whom it is not in their power to restrain, practice it, can be no sin of theirs: and if they judge,
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:40528:259"/> that the practice of it is a sin in those, who practice it, how are they the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> scandalized, when their conscience is supposed resolved in the case, that it is a sin, and they have all the liberty they can desire to forbear it, no one going about to impose it on them. Our Cathedrals stand indeed open to those, who will thither resort to that kind of Service, but if any approve not that way, there are Parish-Churches for their free recourse, where the practice is plainer: none are forced to our Quires, nor blamed for not coming to them (if they attend the regular wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God elsewhere) saving onely such who are of the body of them; and even they had their choice, whether they would have taken upon them those places, to which such an obligation is appendant. Whereby it is evident, that those who pretend the consciences of men with us, to be burdened, amongst other spiritual oppressions, by Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical musick, and singing prayers, seek onely to draw an unjust <hi>Odium</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Church, and discover their own complaints not to be without malice:
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:40528:260"/> That the world might think they have reason for their secession and clamours, they cry out of the pressure of injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are not in being.</p>
                     <p>But it will be said, still there is the <hi>power of Example</hi> to induce men into this suspicious practice, and the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of great mens example upon infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours being considered, this is scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal forcible enough.

If in the mean while, there be any persons of an amphibious condition, who doubt
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:40528:260"/> whether the practice in contest be good as we say, or evil as they say, as these can be but very few (and therefore the pretence touching the <hi>multitude</hi> falls) so, if any of those do practice without full perswasion of Faith, let all judge who gives the scandal, <hi>We,</hi> who avow our own practice, and, though we are assured we can justifie it before God and men, yet leave those who are unsatisfied to their liberty in this regard, requiring onely, that as they are not censured by us for the use of their liberty, so neither that they cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure others; Or <hi>They,</hi> who s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="481" facs="tcp:40528:261"/> own experience; namely, That where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we pretend this kind of Musick and Singing, to be an help of devotion, they for their part find it clean contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Possilly they will tell us, they censure not those who use it, nor load the practice with ignominious names, nor regard much any other arguments against it, but this their own sense, out of which they cannot suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be argued: They cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it fit for Christian worship, because they are conscious, that it consists not with the peoples understanding (which yet is required, as we have said in the Apostolical rule) and therefore if it do beget any good affection) as we pretend (such good affection must be onely some slight and confused passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the more sensitive part, and short infinitely of that rational devotion, or those distinct acts of Faith, love and gratitude, which are exerted by holy men in the paying such a Worship, each passage of which is understood: and besides, there are very few, if any, of the common people that can join herein, so that such service can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:40528:262"/> be the common act of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, but is limited onely to those of the Quire, most of whom also are concerned meerly as to the Notes and Musick, little, or seldom attending the sense, and engaging their souls God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as is necessary.</p>
                     <p>Now, as to this objection, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess in good earnest, I look not upon it as a pretence or cavil in those who make it, but as their real thoughts: &amp; as to the whole sober and serious part of those, who dissent from our Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral Service, I really believe, some such misprision, as this, is summarily the ground of their averseness. Before, therefore, I come to the particulars, supposed to be matter of experience or spiritual sense, I shall humbly request such persons, that they will do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and me, and above all, the cause of Truth, so much justice, as with me a little to reflect, modestly and imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, upon this their experience in the gross. First, when they came to make tryal (if ever they did) whether they could in a spiritual sort worship God in the Choral way, did they not come
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:40528:262"/> prejudiced against the Liturgy it self, against our Vestments and Ceremonies, as well as against the Musick? Having been bred up in time of a general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suetude of such things, and seasoned with ill opinions of them, were they not surprised with variety of passions and concernments, partly at the Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (as to themselves) partly at the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefulness of sundry occurrencies? And if so, then Secondly, How can they look upon themselves, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such little disturbances, to have been capable of making a fair and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did judgment or tryal? They were not haply, so far acquainted with the very Text of the Liturgy, as to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the reasons and particular excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies thereof, had it been officiated in the plainest way: how then can they justly lay the blame of their not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, of their want of due affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and consent, upon the sole Musick, when it is plain, they wanted such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requisite information, as might capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citate them for such devotion; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, their minds, being not void of disorder, could not calmly attend,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:40528:263"/> much less understand, consider, and dispose themselves to consent. It may be very true upon the whole, in stead of devotion, they were under some confusion, and forfeited that compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness of mind which is necessary for the meet Worship of God: but possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly it is not true, that the Musick alone was the occasion of it; and they would have found it far otherwise, had they been acquainted with the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice before hand, as our people gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are (which is but a part of due preparation) or had they not suffered by those other prejudices and distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances, that arose from thence. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons not well informed, or discompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, are very unmeet Judges. These men therefore, whose experience is so contrary to that of other sober persons in the same case, (and possibly, to the general nature of mankind) have all the reason in the world to suspect this their experience: and though they may esteem it to be a kind of spiritual sense, yet perhaps it is but some pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar complication of passions incident unto them, by reason of those unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:40528:263"/> circumstances they are or were under: And then, the judgment framed here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon must needs be as fallacious, as its grounds. Wherefore, if they will reasonably and justly urge this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it behooves them first, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themselves of the particulars of our Service, and satisfie themselves touching the innocency of those small ceremonies in use amongst us, that they may not be surprised by the strangeness of either to them; then, to lay aside all manner of prejudice, which the fate of their education may have instilled into them; and being thus qualified, lastly, to make some second and better tryals, wherein they may be able to avow their impartiality.</p>
                     <p>And that then the success may be otherwise, will be evident by the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the presumed particulars of their experience; of which the first is, that our Musick and singing consists not with the generalities understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Whereto, I say, onr Quires may be better understood, as to what they sing, than any Parochial assembly in their common and mxit singing. The
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:40528:264"/> blending of so many different and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular voices, their drawlings and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted tones, much more confound the words, than does our regular course. Witness our daily experience in the case: I forbear particular instances, how little our Congregations are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in their singing (nay, how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle many times they themselves under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, as to the greater part of them) because such instances might be odious. But that our Quires may, with great facility, be understood, if people will not be notoriously wanting to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, is manifest; First, for that as to the main, touching all that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly sung, it is known before hand, that it will be sung such a day, and such a part of the day: The general Hymns, Responds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> our people have without book: The Psalms for the day, or season, all that have Books can turn to, and most join with the Quire: Those that have not, or cannot use them, may stand as neer some of the plain distinct voices of the Singers, or of some of the people who sing plainly, as they can, and by this
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:40528:264"/> means understand all, and join, as to their minds, in the address. All the difficulty is in the Anthems, because these vary: but it is known first, that each Church has particular Books of its particular Anthems, which are disperst amongst the people with intimation, which is the Anthem to be sung at that time. Then, that most Anthems be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken out of the Psalms, all who have Prayer-books are furnisht with co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of them. Besides, that frequent use makes the particular Anthems known in each Church, so that our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry people can repeat most of them. Lastly, there is the same advantage in this case, as beforesaid touching the Psalms, of some distinct clear voices, which may be understood every sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by any, who attend to them. And indeed, our present graceful way of singing comes so neer distinct pronunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, that there is not so much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in understanding all, word for word, as is pretended, especially to those who are the least used to it. So that I may confidently averr, such who without prejudice attend, may easily
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:40528:265"/> understand, what is sung in our Quires, if they are not negligent, or, in a sort, stupid.</p>
                     <p>And the understanding being the great passage of all into the rational soul, this first imputation of our Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicks rendring what is sung unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, being proved thus manifestly injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the other, for the main fall of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. For, as to the second, what shall hinder our Singings operating to as distinct and plenary devotion as may be, if all, that is sung, is, or (if peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple prove not grosly negligent) may be most distinctly understood, and with much more certainty &amp; ease, than in the Parcchial way? if my understanding can frame distinct notions, my will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may exert as distinct desires or vows.</p>
                     <p>And therefore Thirdly, if by the peoples joining with the Quire, in the praises or petitions they sing, be meant the peoples consent, it is plain by what we have now said, that this is no wise hindered. But if thereby be meant, the conjunction of their voices to those of the Quire, as this is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies necessary, so neither is it in far
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:40528:265"/> the greatest part of what is sung pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. There are few, if any of our people, who are the least used to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Service, but can, and do sing with the Quire the plain Tones of the Psalms, in which too very often, we sing our most usual Hymns, the <hi>Te De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, Magnificat,</hi> and the rest. The same I must say of the Responds, when (as most commonly) plainly sung. Nay, even in the very <hi>Chorus's</hi> of our Anthems, as many as can sing musical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly may, and in the Versicles, or any other part of the Service, if any can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not or may not vocally join, it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cient, that the consent of their hearts di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly go along with the voices of those who sing. Weare certain in the antient Christian Church, the people generally sung onely some <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or closes of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: &amp; this was taken undoubtedly from the like practice of the Jewes, of which we have some foot-steps in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> V, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where we find the words, at which the generality struck in, are said to have been, <hi>For he is good, for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy endureth for ever;</hi> and yet it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="490" facs="tcp:40528:266"/> the house.</hi> Notwithstanding it is plain by what we have said, much more is allowed, and daily practised by the people amongst us.</p>
                     <p>But will some say, I cannot keep my mind attent to the things, except di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly I use the words, which it is granted I may not (at least alwayes) in the Quire. I answer, that is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, you may as well distinctly attend to the things signified by words, when those words are uttered by another, as when they are uttered by your selves. But if the exercise of the Organs of of speech be to any alwayes so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, there may be a kind of low whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering singing, as well as there is such a speaking, which many use after the Minister in the publick Prayers, and which will spoil no Harmony, yet suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently exercise your private self. It is sure God understands this, and those who find it necessary may use such still voice, when they cannot, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance of others, sing more audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole, I profess I see no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>advantage to devotion, which can
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:40528:266"/> be imputed to our Choral way, used as it ought to be, or may be, and I hope generally is. But if any do find it, to put them under any such disadvantage, as they ought to impute this to a certain <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Having thus answered all the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons<note place="margin">Sect. 15.</note> I could meet with or frame, which I could judge of moment, against our Church musick, I might here have end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Discourse: for I may seem much to have anticipated my self, as to the last Head proposed in the beginning (the spiritual advantage to be made by our present way of singing) having evinced the conducency of our practice to the most spiritual or Evangelic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </argument>
                     <p>I Have already said, I do not conceive<note place="margin">Sect: 1.</note> my self yet discharged as to the last Head of this Discourse. My business therefore now is to enquire, more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly, how we may manage our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent singing, in all our sacred Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, to the most spiritual advantage: for it is sure, God is then most truly praised, when our hearts are most en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged and drawn forth toward him. Now, to this purpose, the point of main concernment is, How we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress whatever may be conceived amiss, or at least improveable, in our respective practices. Whatever those particulars are in our Choral way, I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any of them to be of such nature or importance, as require any alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Publick Laws. As to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular statutes of some Churches, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell what may be said: I must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily leave the judgment of them to such, who are particularly concerned and conversant therein, being my self but
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:40528:268"/> acquainted but in very few. It is,<note place="margin">Gloss: ad Decr. Greg l: 1. Tit: 25. Ver: <hi>Donet Lecti. ones.</hi>
                        </note> in effect, acknowledged by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-Lawyers, that the different cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms of several Churches, render it a matter very difficult generally to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine, what belongs to the Office of each Dignitary in the Quire. Yet, supposing any tolerable concord for the main, betwixt the customs or statutes of particular Churches, several Dignitaries or persons must, by their Office, be inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted with a power sufficient for what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection or correction we shall desire; and so, neither here will there need any change of Laws, if the persons im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered will be faithful to their Office. And truly the change, as to matter of practice, will be so easie, as that it cannot possibly make any noise where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever introduced: so that upon the whole, none concerned need to fear the danger of making such change, who shall be convinced, that the practice we shall propose (being supposed a Point settled by no Law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore arbitrary and changeable) is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more conducing to spiritual Worship, than that which is in use al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:40528:269"/> Now, before I come to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, that I may not seem to have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected any general, which may give light into the case in hand, I shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise a brief View of the Old Jewish Quire, and then consider the common state of ours; both which having in our eye, and together regarding the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall rules before laid down, we may hope, what we shall conclude may escape the censure of being Rash, though hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not of being Insufficient.</p>
                     <p>The old <hi>Jewish Quire</hi> is, as above-said,<note place="margin">Sect 2.</note> that <hi>Divine Originall,</hi> whence first we derive, and which, with such <hi>variations</hi> as the <hi>Evangelicall Oeconomy,</hi> the present <hi>Age, People</hi> and <hi>State</hi> of affaires do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, we pretend to transcribe: of this therefore it is necessary we take some view. And certainly it was not without some considerable design of providence, that an account hereof is set down so particularly in holy writt, especially in the <hi>Chronicles</hi> and in the <hi>Titles</hi> of the <hi>Psalms.</hi>

On extraordinary seasons and festivals, the solemnity was onely greater, and the Quire ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler: And besides the Quire, there were certain Priests which sounded with Trumpets, but these, I conceive, distinct from the Quire, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> XX. 26. and to sound usually before the Song of the Lord begun, 2 Chron. VII. 6. <hi>The Priests sounded the Trumpet before them, and all the people stood.</hi> The design of the Trumpets was, as above proved, to notifie the sacrifice to the people, and therefore it may reasonably be presumed, the sounding of them did not commonly interfeer with the Song (which begun, saith <hi>Maimonides,</hi> at the time of the Wine, that is, the <hi>Drink-offerings</hi> being pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out) but prepare the people for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. I do not deny, but that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some extraordinary solemnities, such as was the dedication of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the <hi>Trumpetters and Singers were as one, to make one sound to be heard in prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and thanking the Lord:</hi> (2 Chron.

Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I do not conceive the Priests to have sounded constantly at the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual burnt-offerings every day (which yet were constantly attended as before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, with the service of the Quire) but onely upon their Festivals and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn days; because the letter of the Law, touching the institution of the trumpets limits the use of them (as to the<note place="margin">P.

                        <q>All the three chief mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians (and therefore, undoubtedly, <note place="margin">De Rep: Iud. c. 15.</note> a greater number of the Singers respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively under them) were to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, <hi>Asaph</hi> being to assist <hi>Heman</hi> on the right hand, and <hi>Ethan</hi> or <hi>Jedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thun</hi> to assist him on the left,</q> and all to join in the song of the Lord.

                        <hi>Psaltery.</hi> And that, there might be two sorts, is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable; for, after the <hi>Psalteries</hi> made and introduced by <hi>David,</hi> of the form of which we have already spoke, there were others made of <hi>Algum wood</hi> by King <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>there were none such seen before in the Land, 1 Chron.</hi> IX. 11.</p>
                     <p>Now that which induces me to this opinion, that the <hi>Psaltery</hi> was a wind-instrument (besides the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of authorities, diverse of which I have produced, and could add more, were it not tedious) is, First, The <hi>Etymon</hi> of the word, by which it properly signifies a <hi>Bottle made of dry or dressed leather;</hi> and, that they should make a <hi>stringed</hi> instrument of such <hi>form</hi> or <hi>materials,</hi> seems to me very improbable. Secondly, the natural probability of the thing, it tending more (<hi>ad complementus Musices</hi>) to the perfection of Musick, and of the Quires performances in that kind, that these three instruments should be of
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:40528:276"/> three distinct kinds, than that two of them should be of one, and the third of another, when (possibly) of the noblest kind of instruments (for such do I conceive wind-instrnments to be) according to the contrary <hi>Hypothesis</hi> there must not be one. Thirdly, the authority of <hi>Josephus</hi> designing (as it may seem) to prevent, or favourably decide the controversie, who having told us the <hi>Harp had ten strings,</hi> adds presently the <hi>Psaltery had twelve sounds.</hi> What precisely he meant thereby, we may be ignorant, but in the general, we cannot conceive he would have changed his terms, had the instruments he spoke of, been both of the same kind. I will set down his words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause none may suspect me of design, or wilful partiality: they are these; <gap reason="foreign">

IV.</hi> title) that is, as <hi>Tremellius</hi> truly, laying aside all the more conjectural Glosses of others, interprets it, On the <hi>stringed</hi> instruments: another on <hi>Nechiloth (Ps.</hi> V. title.) that is, according to the same interpreter, on <hi>Wind-instruments:</hi> and <hi>Asaph</hi> chief Cymbalist, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> XVI. 5.</p>
                     <p>Together with these instruments, as already proved, was sung the <hi>song of the Lord,</hi> yet so, as that some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of song may be observed.

                     <p>Further, in the very self-same Psalm or song, some little variation of sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I presume, may be inferr'd from that word <hi>Selah,</hi> which, to omit all the learned Glosses thereon, signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in its natural import no more than <hi>Elevation,</hi> I take to have been in some proportion of the like force with them, if not as a sharp, yet as the usual letter for lowd musick is with us.

                        <q>
                           <hi>A</hi> mixt and changeable kind of song, which was sung with all Musicall varietyes at the same time.</q> So that upon the whole it appeares, There was in the old Jewish Quire variety in their Vocal Musick, proportionable to that of their Instrumental.</p>
                     <p>Nor was this their Chorall practice a businesse of one age, but from its first

                     <p>Such was the Jewish Quire, their number of members, their quality, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,<note place="margin">Sect. 3.</note> performance vocal and instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and such their time and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.

The first visible

Some few of the elder more able of these are usually ordained Deacons or Priests, for
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:40528:287"/> for the service of God in the Quire, and in that capacity officiate in our Quires: the others still retaining their Lay-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. The number of these is very different, according to the several con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, endowments, and founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Quires respectively: but a Quire of less than twelve, in duty bound to attend, I have no where, to my knowledge, seen, and seldome or never of so few.</p>
                     <p>As to <hi>instruments,</hi> we generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our selves with the <hi>Organ</hi> alone, that indeed being (as now it is perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted) deservedly to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and supplying well the room of all other instruments; and besides this its preeminence in variety and fulness, employing fewest hands, and not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to be out of tune upon every little accident, or requiring new tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning each time it is used, as commonly stringed instruments do.

                     <p>Such being the constitution, and such the government of our Quires, it<note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> may seem a little wonderful, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter such strict discussions of the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of all things, as this age has seen, there should any thing remain amongst us▪ practised in the Worship of God which sober men might esteem obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or blameable: and truly I know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that nature, which can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the authority of Sanction, or even of approved custome, for its sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. The levity and unconcerned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that some of our Quire-men disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the performance of their Office, is, I am sure, frequently check<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t, and not unpunisht in several of our Quires. What is neer a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="535" facs="tcp:40528:288"/> in which, from any overt acts, conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at by their superiours, the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers may justly be taxed of want of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riousness. If there be such instances, let all the world know, I apologize not for them, nor is it my intent in this discourse, in the least, to excuse them. But, to speak freely my sense, the summe of what I judge most obnoxious to just censure, is made up of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars following.</p>
                     <p>First, it may be conceived, that some of our Anthems and Services, as our Church-composers have ordered the matter, savour more of <hi>curiosity</hi> of <hi>musick,</hi> than design of devotion. Whereas all Musick used in the worship of God, ought to be reverential, grave and easie, accommodated as well to the intelligibleness of the words, as to such tender affections and meltings of soul, as we profess it intended to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, we may observe, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, our Gentlemen sometimes bring us aiery, and even mimical composures, difficult and distractive of the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers thoughts, and not consistent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough with the hearers understanding.
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:40528:289"/> They contrive our Church-musick, in compliance with the vanity and vices of the age, and are more concerned to shew themselves <hi>Artists a la mode,</hi> than to fit their Melody for the engaging their own and others hearts in pious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections towards God. From hence it comes to pass, that, Secondly, we have, in several of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>se new pieces, strangely needless and nauseous, not to say sensless, repetitions; of such words or clauses I mean, on which no <hi>Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> lies fit to detain thought, or exercise devotion. If any word consist of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant and voluble syllables, fitter than others to bear some little sequel of Notes, which the Musician fancies, it shall be da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>lied with, and tost as a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the air, for no other reason, but because the Artist would shew his skill thereby, and tickle the ears and fancies of vainer minds: Whereas it is truly more a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t, I am sure it ought to be more the business of our Choral Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, to reconcile musick, and the sense of the words. The Notes should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the matter; and as for such repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as the completing the Musick does
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:40528:289"/> require, they should be made on words or clauses, which, by reason of their pregnant import (<hi>decies repetita place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunt</hi>) have still a new gratefulness in them, the more repeated, because they administer fresh matter of thought, and ardour of affection, to the devout soul. Thirdly, it may be adjudged another fault, neer a kin hereto, that these Gentlemen choose out <hi>words</hi> for Anthems as they <hi>sound,</hi> and not as they <hi>signifie.</hi> Nor is it enough to bear them out, that they be able to say, the words are express Scripture; for, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what we have above spoken, words may be unfit for Anthems, not onely because the soundness of their sense is suspicious, but, because they do not properly suit with the business of divine praise. Unsound, we will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, nothing of Scripture can be, but, it is not the hundreth part of Scripture that was designed for La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> is, nor ought therefore to be sung to God Anthem wise. People might as well turn the Genealogies of the Patriarchs, or of our Lord Jesus, into Anthems, as some places of Scripture which they ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> done.</p>
                     <pb n="538" facs="tcp:40528:290"/>
                     <p>Lastly, I cannot tell, whether some may judge our simple Voluntaries, or Musick, which no words accompany, not so congruous to the Christian state, and Worship. For my own part, I profess, they offend not, but help me: yet I will not say, but something more apt to general edification, might be substituted in their room. This is the summe total of such particulars in our Choral practice, as I can judge blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or improveable.</p>
                     <p>Now, if we search into the Original of these (and that is the first step to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards<note place="margin">Sect 5.</note> their redress) we shall find them, for the greatest part, due to the want of Learning, and meet institution in the common sort of our Quire-men and Church-musicians. To confess inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously, when it pleased God to <hi>bring back the captivity of Zion,</hi> if we were not <hi>as men that dreamt,</hi> yet we were truly surprised, and unprovided in a great measure, to celebrate, as we would, the happiness God had vouchsafed us, and the wonderful and most undeserved grace and goodness of the Doner. The truth is, the rage of the War, having
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:40528:290"/> scattered our Quire-men, and ravisht from them their subsistence, had also put them to seek their bread in mean, miserable and illiberal waies: and those few Principles of Literature, which any of them had, were, by that means, extinguisht or lost, rather than impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, their natural parts lowerd and debased, or worse: so that the thin number of them, who survived these calamities to see the Restauration, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained nothing but their Musick, which possibly they would have lost too in a great part, but that their necessities would not permit them to <hi>hang their harps upon the willows,</hi> their Musical skill being the most considerable means of support then left them. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, they were not then to <hi>sing the Song of the Lord,</hi> nor any of the <hi>songs of Zion,</hi> but to contrive their melodies to the humour of such who would feed them: The influence hereof, both up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Musicians, and Musick, is sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than I will speak of. Now such as these generally being the persons, which, at the Restauration, were to be made use of (or none) to retrieve
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:40528:291"/> the goodly Choral practice, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented themselves to indoctrinate those, whom they were to breed for successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in what onely themselves now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood: and, if they made even the most pregnant of these to be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Musicians, they esteemed it a mighty service done the Church, and thought themselves amply to have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged their Office. This I take to be the great reason, why many of our Church-musicians are nothing but Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians. And, besides this, I do not know, whether there be not some lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fate, or secret fascination, in the case, that those, who intimately study and understand musick, without great importunity, never give themselves to the study of any thing else, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire no excellencies so much as, those of their own art. I confess my self to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire Musick, as much, I think, as any man ought to do: but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all the value I have for it, I cannot think this alone is a sufficient ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment for a rational creature, or ought to be made, as it were, the sole business of a mans life: and it would
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:40528:291"/> really move lamentation in any conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man, to see how <hi>ill</hi> very great skill in musick oftentimes <hi>dwells.</hi> Some persons, upon this alone, may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to value themselves above the most universal scholars ordinarily to be met with; whereas, take them out of that art, and they want the common judgment of men. And, though few or none of our Quire-composers may, I hope, deserve so severe a character, yet, with grief I speak it, if I should be challenged, out of all them that I have known, to produce ten persons, who, with their musick, understood Grammatical English, I should be to seek for some of the number. <hi>All</hi> the consequences hereof <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>urge not, but, I may safely say, such being the defect in these mens education, Hence it comes to pass, that the younger sort being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent on the musick, generally neglect the matter of what they sing; and the elder have onely a confused notion thereof: Hence, too, that levity, hast and unconcernedness, which is observable in some of their performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. These were the two first imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:40528:292"/> mentioned. Of the same Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, also, is the unmeetness of much of our new musick in excessive curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, aieriness and difficulty; as also those frivolous repetitions, and that playing with words above taxed. Nor, in summe, can I refer the imprudent choice of Words for Anthems, and whatever there is of like nature, to any more unquestionable source: and I have good reason to assure my self, there are not a few of my mind.</p>
                     <p>Now the redress of this defect is as<note place="margin">Sect. 6.</note>
                        <hi>necessary,</hi> as <hi>easie,</hi> though possibly it cannot altogether beeffected on the sudden. That it is <hi>necessary,</hi> none can doubt, who believes the Worship of God to consist in any thing else, but trifling, sport, lip-labour, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying mens carnal sense: and all the <hi>difficulty,</hi> that is in it, lies in taking care, for the future, of better <hi>educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> our Choristers, and of <hi>supplying vacancies,</hi> as they fall, at present with men of more <hi>solid learning,</hi> though not of so exquisite voices and skill. Musick moderately good, is best, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, to all intents and purposes; but
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:40528:292"/> of this more anon. In the mean time, the first step to a redress in this case, I have said to be greater <hi>care</hi> in the <hi>edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of our <hi>Choristers,</hi> that they be not taught musick alone, but, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therewith, <hi>Grammar,</hi> and some <hi>Humane Learning;</hi> but, especially, that they be well instructed in <hi>Religion,</hi> by being brought not onely to repeat their Catechism, as usual, but inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately to understand it, and carried a little further into the doctrine of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity. For, it is plain, by the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of our Church-Catechism, it was designed chiefly for children before Confirmation: and no one can doubt<note place="margin">Dr. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Now, for such institution of these small people as I desire, I cannot suppose, but the statutes of every Cathedral or Collegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Church, have made provision: at least I never knew, nor heard of any such Church in <hi>England,</hi> which had not a Grammar-School belonging to it. Nay, even in all lesser Religious Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses or Bodies, where the Fraternity maintained before-time, a Grammar-School-master, and a Preacher, it was<note place="margin">1 Edw. 6. c. 14</note> enacted by Statute, soon upon the dissolution, that lands, tenements &amp; hereditaments should be s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="545" facs="tcp:40528:293"/> This shews us, the judgment of the Church-men of those dayes was not, that learning to sing was the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of a mans life: and, if any of our Musicians now are so fond of their art, as to tell us, if we will have boys fit for the Quire, they must attend no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but song and musick, their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is not to be indulged, nor they allowed their humour herein. After a year or two sole attending song, if the boyes are capable, and the Masters di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, some lesser practice daily will perfect them, and a good part of each day may be allocated to such purpose, as I contend for. The influence here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of would be much greater, than I have yet spoken: for, by this means, our Quire-men being in part bred scholars, would be more intelligent and serious, not onely in their Office in the Church, but abroad in their conversations; and in private too, they would be able to entertain themselves, and delight in reading, study and meditation, which might both improve them in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, virtue, and even in Divine musick it self, and also keep them

Methinks it is a little iniquitous to prefer musick alone, before musick in conjunction with other liberal Arts and Sciences. It hath really moved pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in me sometimes, to consider a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, grave, learned person, who had served a double or treble appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeship to good literature of all sorts, and past several Scholastical degrees in the Univerisity, to have sat down in a Countrey Vicarage, or small Rectory, of fifty or sixty pound <hi>per ann.</hi> whither, possibly, he might bring with him, amongst his Books, from the Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a <hi>Basse Viol</hi> (the more portable and most considerable reserves of his other instruments, and musical divertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) which he could tune three or four wayes, and, betwixt his voice and it, with pretty variety make a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle quire by himself: This person, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides great diversity of other Learning, and deep knowledge in Divinity, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding

Besides such students, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we may find other persons of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther education, though not Choral neither, who understand Musick as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately as most do, and are masters of many other accomplishments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, who would not look upon the Quire-service either as toil some or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable. Now, suppose some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of either sort (and both are suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed men of understanding and serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness) should be taken in to fill up pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as they become void, till such time we have like hopeful Plants out of our own Nurseries, would it not be more for the credit of the Church, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of Religion, than to entail this Divine Office on men, for the most part, meerly musicians; touching which profession, I need not fear to
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:40528:298"/> record this observation, that, as there is nothing more sweet than that soul wherein Learning, Virtue and Musick dwell, so, on the contrary, there is nothing usually more intolerably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited and fantastical, than a meer Musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian.</p>
                     <p>There are onely two things, which I see objectible against what I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended touching these supplies, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the former is, that this would be a great discouragement to our young Quire-men, who have been bred up, and done service in expectation of these little promotions, which, according to this practice, they must certainly be disappointed of. Whereto I say, First, I conceive it will rather be to them an incentive to diligence and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, when they see it is not their meer musical skill, but their other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements in religious knowledge and virtue, which must prefer them: and if they are thus improved, God forbid that they should be put by. As on the other side, Secondly, if they be, for the main, devoid of such improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the places they have, be they
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:40528:299"/> as mean as any of them use to be, are incouragements enough for them; and, if any of them think otherwise, let them seasonably divert to other imploiments, and, possibly, both they and the Church may be better provided for.</p>
                     <p>The other Objection is, that by this means, our Church-musick may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come much poorer, and degenerate from those refined perfections, to which it is at present arrived. And to this, I answer, in a Text of the Canon-Law. <hi>In sacro ministerio dum blanda vox quaeritur, congrua vita negligitur: &amp; cantor minister Deum moribus stimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat, cum populum vocibus delectat.</hi> It<note place="margin">Dist. 92. In Sancta.</note> is not impossible, some men have been more curious in Church-musick, than God or his Church will thank them for: and, if we will hearken either to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers or Councils, such nicety in sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as some men seem to affect, may well be forborn. Art, indeed, was by divine institution to be used (as we have seen) and otherwise it is scarce possible, but that singing to God, must be one of the most ungrateful, nauseous and reproachful Offices imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:40528:299"/> We would not therefore, that persons either wanting musical skill, or of grating and untuneable voices, should be appointed to this Office, whatever their other learning may be.

                     <p>The onely point of this kind, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining undispatcht, is our <hi>Voluntaries,</hi> of the lawfulness and design of which

We observed above amongst the various musical Performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Jewish Church, what the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of the Psalms stile a <hi>Psalm-song,</hi> wherein we found the practice to be this, the mustick begun, and the Song or Hymn followed: If this use were gravely or decently drawn into exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in stead of simple Voluntaries, some single voice, or lesser <hi>Chorus,</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Organ with a short Hymn, many peoples devotion would be less at a loss, and in stead of rambling at large, have whereon to fix, and such a conduct of thought, as, it may be, many want.

                        </gap>salms, parcelld out, and accommodated in the best sort he shall judge, for the use of his charge; for that these Psalms are sung onely as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thems: and, if he have power to do as much as this comes to, nay, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same in a manner, in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>athedral, much more has he in a private Parish. I add further, that such Psalms so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed and directed by the Bishop of the Diocese, would be of much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular authority than these, which the people now sing: and even without the approbation or direction of the Bishops, as to these which we now have, I must say, as there is no English Version ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:40528:306"/> that I ever yet could see, which is not incomparably better than them, so there is one which has much better authority already, particularly, that excellent one by King <hi>James</hi> of blessed memory. That, beside the authority which it derived from its Royal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, was published <hi>cum privilegio re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giae majestatis,</hi> with a Royal priviledge from his Majesty; and of what force the Kings Prerogative is in such Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical affairs, I leave to those to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute, who allow many things in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worship, without authority from it, or indeed, without any other san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps, what many others, as well as my self, would perswade, might we be heard, touching this Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of King <hi>James</hi>'s, or any other to come in the room of that usual, may be a good while unpracticable: and therefore, all the redress we can at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent expect in this behalf, must be from the Ministers of the respective Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes, by their picking and culling out what is fittest for their peoples devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and instructing them in the due
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:40528:306"/> use thereof. Commonly it may not be expedient to take a whole Psalm as it lies, but here and there a verse: and though possibly, some people would not endure the introducing of a Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation wholely new, yet the altering sometimes a word or two, may a little polish the style, and advance the sense, and by this means, some small amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the singing. Psalms may be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
                     <p>The next step must be to tune the peoples voices into some <hi>Decorum,</hi> or tolerable harmony, that the Praises of God may be sung so, as not to make a great number Loath the performance: and for this purpose, there is not any better mean than an Organ, which it were to be wished in all richer Parishes were provided; nor would it be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of so great difficulty or expence, as is generally conceived. But, because this can be had onely in some few Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes, we must turn our thoughts to what other methods we can devise. And in the first place, let care be taken, that such a person begin the tuning of the Psalm, as has himself a tunable

<pb n="573" facs="tcp:40528:309"/> should be out done by any probable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to a more rational and spiritual sort of lauding God, than what is in practice with her.

Did I know any thing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contrary to any Law or determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Church, I should either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punge it, or lay aside the whole for the sake of what were Heterodox, and not conform to those Rules which the Church gives us, and to which I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily submit my self, promising to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke any thing I have written, if I shall be convinced of any discrepancy thereinto the Doctrine or allowed pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of our Church, or to the great end of advancing true &amp; spirituall Devotion.</p>

                     <p>The second Opinion is of a more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid sort, who having observed the great mischief, that some kind of <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching</hi> has done, could be very well content to have a general restraint of that arbitrary exercise hereof, which all Ministers take; and supposing that they had constantly the <hi>publick prayers</hi> and the <hi>Scriptures</hi> read, and now and then an <hi>Homily</hi> or two for the Generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Catechism f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

These men mean well, but the estate of our Church, and the manners of our people would be very ill consulted, should their advice take. The World will not now be perswaded, that the Ministry need no personal abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

There is indeed a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt what preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel was at first, and what we call preaching now, as we shall presently see; and 'tis not impossible, there may be a multitude of pretended Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preachers (an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

Namely (1.) Whether the <hi>Preaching of the Gospel,</hi> spoken of in Scripture, and <hi>Gospel-preaching,</hi> or what we call at present in usual speech <hi>Preaching,</hi> differ? And supposing there be a difference, in what points mainly that lies? (2.) Of what <hi>authority</hi> then <hi>our present Preaching is?</hi> (3.) On what <hi>occasion,</hi> and by what <hi>means</hi> and <hi>degrees,</hi> this diversity has come into the Church? (4.) What <hi>Necessity</hi> any men, in truth and reason, may plead, lies upon them to <hi>preach,</hi> as at present we understand <hi>Preaching?</hi> And Lastly, what in probability would be the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:40528:316"/> ensuing, in case what we now call Preaching should grow into disuse, or be generally restrained in ordinary Congregations? And I trust in the management of each of these, none shall have reason to complain of my want of temper.</p>

                     <p>As to the strict importance of this Phrase in the New Testament, there can no notion be more certainly made out by the very Letter of Scripture, than that <hi>preaching the Gospel</hi> signifies the publishing, proclaiming or making known the Christian doctrine to people, who at the time of such <hi>preaching</hi> had not received, or perhaps heard of, Christianity. Thus the words which are rendred <hi>preaching,</hi> and the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual use of them, as well in the holy as in common Writers, most plainly prove. <gap reason="foreign">

So that we must allow, both that many <hi>Teachers</hi> were also <hi>prophets</hi> (for what should hinder more gifts than one to be inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, or concur in the same person? Or, what gift more fitly qualifying a person to be a <hi>Teacher</hi> in the Church, than that of <hi>prophesying</hi> in this notion?) and that <hi>prophesying</hi> in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:40528:319"/> signifies interpreting Scriptures, as abovesaid; though (as the learned Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> notes) not excluding, but containing sometimes the gift of foretelling things to come, as we read of <hi>Agabus</hi> and others. That this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for is the main sense, wherein <hi>prophesying</hi> is to be taken, as thereby we mean a certain <hi>Gift</hi> or <hi>Office</hi> in the inspired Church, is most plain from the whole <hi>XIV.</hi> Chapter of the first to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and from diverse other places of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles on the same subject, too long and too many now to insist on. That this may reasonably enough be stiled prophesying, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from hence, because supposing the interpretation given, consonant to the Scriptures, it is but delivering the same Doctrine that the Prophets did, onely removing the obscurities, and making the Vision plainer; a kind of continuation and perfecter advance of their Office.

<pb n="593" facs="tcp:40528:321"/> in their writings. And though there may be just question, whether that <hi>Philip,</hi> who <hi>Preached Christ</hi> to <hi>Samaria,</hi> were <hi>Philip</hi> the Apostle, or rather the<note place="margin">Acts: VIII. 5.</note> Deacon (<hi>Acts</hi> VI.) and so, whether he had that immediate outward mission be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore said to have belonged to the first Preachers of the Gospel, yet, as I make<note place="margin">Vid: Act: 21. 8.</note> no question, but all will allow him to have been an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> so I am sure there can be no doubt of his being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately inspired; for so much the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel in the History of him, relating to the Eunuch, doth manifestly evince: Besides that it is certain, <hi>Samaria</hi> at the time of his Preaching had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Faith. So that we are still inforced to conclude these two points peculiar to the first and proper preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gospel, Divine inspiration for the assistance of the Preacher, &amp; Infidels, or which is much the same, Jewes, for his Auditors: and truly I see little reason not to admit the third also, of an <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary commission:</hi> for, supposing the first and onely proper Preachers of the Gospel, to have been either Apostles or Evangelists, there is none of sobriety,
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:40528:322"/> will not easily allow their <hi>mission</hi> or <hi>commission extraordinary.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In summe then, the Preaching of the Gospell spoken of so oft in the New Testament, at least that <hi>Preaching,</hi> to which St. <hi>Paul</hi> said there lay a <hi>Necessiey upon</hi> him, was a Publication of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity to the Unbelieving world, and that pursuant to an unlimited Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission (and by the infallible conduct of the Holy Ghost) given immediatly by Christ Jesus. And I shall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, I need to concern my self in saying any more for the proof hereof.</p>
                     <p>By what is said, it plainly appeares, there neither is at present, nor except immediate Inspiration should returne, can hereafter be, any proper preaching of the Gospell in the World. That which comes next to it is the publick Reading the Gospells to those, who as yet known them not; for they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly Truth and Gospel: Thus the reading Moses in the synagogue is (a little Catachrestically) termed Preaching him. <hi>Acts:</hi> XV. 21. <hi>Moses of old time
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:40528:322"/> hath in every. City them that preach him, being read in the Synagogue every Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</hi> And next to that, The publication of Christianity, in sense and terms as agreeable as may be to scripture, either to Jewes, Indians, or such unbelievers, who never yet so much as professed to own the Doctrine of Jesus. Now though both of these may with good colour of reason be Styled Preaching the Gospell, yet it is evident, neither of them comes up to that first Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call performance in this kind, which, as we have said, can onely be accounted the proper Preaching of the Gospell, commonly spoken of in Scripture.</p>

Is it not plain that this, or some such as this (for I concern not my selfe as to those little particularities of method, which some Divines use, or have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed) is the constitution &amp; structure<note place="margin">Sect. 8</note> of our present Sermons?</p>
                     <p>Now of a discourse contrived and framed after this manner, or any better one that wee may conceive, what can we say? Can we call this <hi>Preaching the Gospell,</hi> in the true scripture-notion of the phrase? We cannot certainly: For, as it is an Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of scripture, if of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament applied to Christianity, it is properly, as we have seen, what the first Christians meant by <hi>Prophesying;</hi> and if of the New Testament, it is still
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:40528:324"/> (at least Analogically) <hi>Prophesying;</hi> nor is there any scripture-term so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly applicable to it: As it handles or entreats of any particular Christian Doctrine, it is <hi>Teaching</hi> or <hi>Doctrine:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Cor▪ 14. 6, 26.</note> As it containes what we call the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory part, it is <hi>Exhortation, Reproof Consolation,</hi> or the like; which by way, of Office of old particularly belonged to the Bishops or Pastors of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches respectively. So that our <hi>Preaching,</hi> as it is at present exercised, takes in the work of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Prophets, Teachers, and Bishops or Pastors: but yet, neither is any one of these, nor all in conjunction, the Publication of Christianity to Infidel People; for they all rather suppose Christianity received, and are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to edification of professors, not to the Conversion of aliens.

                     <p>For the difference is great and in many regards. First, the Subject mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">Sect. 9.</note> is <hi>Particular</hi> in our Sermons, viz. this or that point of Faith, or matter of Practice: The subject matter to them who Preached the Gospell was <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi> Christian Religion; to tell men what it was, and to perswade them to it, takeing the best occasions and advantages they could for every thing, and confineing themselves no further to any, than they saw reason from particular circumstances, and the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the hearers.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in respect of the manner of handling, there are many points of difference might be insisted on. Their preaching was Naturall, loose and unpremeditate; Ours Artificiall, methodicall and studied: But chiefly theirs was brief, Various, and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locutory. They continued their speech, usually, but a very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>short space, and then fell off, as their auditours gave them occasion into disputes and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings with them, answering, <hi>pro re nata,</hi> their demands, Objections, Doubts. Our discourses are Sett, as neer as we
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:40528:325"/> can Even, continued a considerable time, and I fear, as some auditours too often judge, tedious. As to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular doubts and questions, we must and do answere them in private: Respect to the assembly, and it may be to the very persons, that propose them, permit not that this be done, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alwayes nor ordinarily, in the Congregation.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, there is yet a greater difference in regard of the <hi>Principle,</hi> by which the Preachers are supposed to be acted. They were assisted immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by an infallible spirit, so that all they spoke was Gospell; and therefore they might require absolute belief and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission: we have indeed the <hi>same sure word</hi> of <hi>Prophesy</hi> as they had, but that onely recorded in Scripture. Our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations &amp; deductions from thence are onely by the strength of reason im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by study, observation, converse, prayer &amp; the Ordinary assistance of the Holy Ghost upon all these: and they are so farr onely certaine, as they agree with scripture and the Analogy of Faith; nor do we urge them further upon mens
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:40528:325"/> consciences, than we can approve them such. Then as to the applicatory part, they of old had that wonderful gift of<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 10. Act. 8. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>, 22.</note> the <hi>discerning of spirits,</hi> and by this undoubtedly knew many times how to direct their discourses to the hearts and particular state of their hearers. We can proceed onely upon common acquaintance with people, credible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and very often our own prudential Conjectures, and therefore must needs in a great measure shoot at a peradventure.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the Auditors, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate design, are very different. To the primitive preachers of the Gospel, as we have already observed, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors were generally Infidels, Jewes, Greeks, Barbarians: To us real, or professed Christians. They were to suppose their hearers strangers from or enemies to the Truth: We are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of an un-Christian sin, called uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableness, if we think ours <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Ours are as truly of Gods Family, as our selves; for ought we know, many of them as sincere Christians, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if of different proficiency, yet
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:40528:326"/> all baptized with us into the same Faith. The thing designed by them, was the bringing their auditories over to Christianity: We finding ours ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally Christian, can onely build them up in our most <hi>Holy</hi> Faith, the profession whereof they have already undertaken.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, There is a difference also, and that very great, in our very mission and sphere of action. The Preachers of the Gospel, in the Scripture-notion, were sent either immediately by Christ with a Commission to preach to <hi>All Nations</hi> for the gathering <hi>Disciples</hi> all the world over; <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>.</note> they had preached a while in one place with such success, as to gain any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number of Proselytes, were to run into another (having frequently immediate revelations to this purpose) and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>leaving onely a <hi>Seminary</hi> (that is the faithful, whom they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, formed into a little Church, little comparatively to ours at present) were to take the world before them. Or where the Apostles themselves could not go, the inspiration which was in
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:40528:326"/> themselves directed them to send other inspired persons, who were plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their Company, and to whom, the Holy Ghost guiding them herein, they gave Commissions, as they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>w sit, as large often as their own. Of this sort, and of such authority were they, whom the Scripture saith to have preached the Gospel. Whereas we are sent imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by the Church onely, and but mediately by Christ, without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of inspiration in the persons im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately sending or sent, and our Walk is limited and appointed us; we are to have the charge of such or such a Flock, and to move onely within our allotted Verge.</p>
                     <p>There might possibly have been as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed several other points of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, but I presume these the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, and amply sufficient to my design. Onely <hi>I</hi> must acknowledge there is one sort of <hi>Preaching,</hi> called commonly, but cantingly, <hi>Gospel-preaching,</hi> the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of which, from the Scripture notion of <hi>preaching the Gospel, I</hi> have not yet stated. <hi>Gospel-preaching</hi> some men call that, which is opposite to the

<pb n="605" facs="tcp:40528:327"/> induce them to. But to return from these extravagants.</p>
                     <p>By what we have already said, we<note place="margin">Sect 10.</note> are able to make a judgment of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to the <hi>Gift</hi> of preaching, a thing that has made so much noise in late years.

The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle designing to set down for peace &amp; regularities sake in the Body of Christ, which is his Church, of what dignity the several Offices and inspirations in the Church were, gives us this account as to the point in hand. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> XII.

The other, whether gifts or offices, as not so neerly belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to our present purpose I meddle not with. What the <hi>Apostles</hi> were, we have sufficiently (to our design) spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken already: these had the plenitude of the Holy Ghost and of power (as I may so speak) extraordinary inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a Commission to preach all the world over. I do not doubt, but those <hi>prophets</hi> mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles, and in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles, and particularly in the passages last ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and said to have then been in the Church, were persons immediately inspired, and that amongst other gifts, especially with the gift of interpreting the Prophesies and Scriptures of the Old Testament, for the happier conversion and confirmation of the Jewes. Out of these I conceive generally the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists</hi> to have been chosen, who were a kind of <hi>secondary</hi> Apostles, inspired persons, taken in by the Apostles to their assistance, and sent abroad indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Apostolical power to preach
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:40528:332"/> the Gospel where they themselves could not come (for they could not be every where) and they were most of them, as Antiquity tells us, of the <hi>seventy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Luke: X. 1.</note> whom our Lord sent Two and Two before his face. These were all extraordinary, and ceased with that extraordinary state of the Church, and to those onely it did belong properly to preach the Gospel; for these onely were qualified with an inspiration, which capacitated them thereto.</p>
                     <p>But whoso diligently considers the Apostles discourse in the Twelfth and Fourteenth of the first to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> will find that there were even in those inspired dayes, <hi>prophets</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesying</hi> of a more ordinary condition than that above mentioned.

                     <p>To summe up all: <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> sent
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:40528:338"/> his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and impowered them to send <hi>Others:</hi> They exercised actually this power, and did send others, and ordered those <hi>Others</hi> thus by them sent to send <hi>Others,</hi> to <hi>ordain Elders</hi> or Priests <hi>in every city,</hi> some of whom (as to the point in hand) by their Office and charge were to <hi>Labour in the Word and Doctrine,</hi> which we at present call <hi>preaching.</hi> These also in their Generation regularly ordained o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as they were appointed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to do; &amp; the orderly succession is come down to us in this present age and Church: This is the summe, of all the sacred right, or Divine authority, of our <hi>Office,</hi> which as Pastours or Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, we have or pretend to.<note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Briefly now as to the <hi>Authority,</hi> that is the <hi>certainty</hi> to <hi>truth</hi> of what we <hi>teach</hi> in way of discharging this part of our Office.</p>
                     <p>First, as to the <hi>Foundation</hi> upon which we build, it is of <hi>Divine</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible authority, <hi>Scripture given by inspiration of God;</hi> the same Doctrine which those infallible preachers of the Gospel delivered by word of mouth first, and then consigned in writing.
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:40528:339"/> We teach nothing necessary to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or done in order to salvation, which is not there contained, or does not, to any mans reason who understands com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense, follow from it. If at any time we teach such matters, which may seem less necessary, we let the world know, they are onely <hi>prudential,</hi> and we press them onely proportionably, and with prudential <hi>Motives.</hi> And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in also we have the example of the great Apostle, expresly discriminating his own sense and advices from Divine ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and commands. <hi>To the rest speak I, not the Lord▪</hi> 1 Cor. <hi>VII,</hi> 12. And again, <hi>This I speak by permission, and not of commandment,</hi> ver. 6.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, as to our <hi>interpretations</hi> of Scripture, and <hi>deductions</hi> from thence, we proceed not upon our own heads. We search what has ever been the sense of the Church, or what the purest ages have consented upon, and we interpret Scripture, where we can have it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to such <hi>consent,</hi> either of the Church Universal, or of the Primitive and purer Church. Where we find not this consent, we compare Scripture
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:40528:339"/> with Scripture, and apply the Analogy of Faith, we examine the context, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, expressions, we pray the assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Gods spirit, we read again, we study, we consider again and again, before we presume to speak our own sense. And after all, we <hi>exercise no Dominion over the faith of any,</hi> but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be believed according to the strength of our reasons.</p>
                     <p>And Lastly, As we openly profess to all the World, that we are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, but men <hi>of like passions</hi> with the rest of Mankind (though we hope ours a little more subdued to reason and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science than all mens are) so on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, that we should not be so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to Errour, as are the common sort, there is all the reason in the world to believe. We are, as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Prophets and Prophets sons above spoken of, bred up in the reading and studying of Holy Scriptures from our Childhood; we are instructed in <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> and peculiarly in the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Languages</hi> of the Scriptures; we <hi>enter into the sheep-fold by the door, and climb not in</hi> any back-way; we <hi>give our
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:40528:340"/> selves</hi> up <hi>to these things.</hi> And then if he, who promised, when he sent forth his Apostles to preach, that he would <hi>be with them to the end of the world</hi> (and that by his, <hi>Spirit</hi> the <hi>Paraclete,</hi> which <hi>should guide them into all truth</hi>) can now, the Apostles being dead, most of them (if not all) sixteen hundred years ago, can, I say, now no otherwise perform his promise, than by being with them in their successors, it is plain that if any sort of men may expect the guidance of the spirit more than others, we are the men. This is the summe of the Authority our Sermons pretend to. For a conclusion whereto, I shall onely say, that were I a <hi>Lay</hi>-person my self, I had rather in a difficult and uncertain matter, undetermin'd by the Church, err with my spiritual Guide, than ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at being in the right by my own self-conceit and way▪ wardness: For as it is scarce possible, that the Errour could be in any great matter, being a point supposed not yet determin'd by the Church, so it is very probable there would be more sin in such my hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the truth, or, at least, in such
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:40528:340"/> my venturing at it, than in an humble and submissive errour, where there were still a preparation of mind to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Truth when seen.</p>
                     <p>I now proceed to the third matter of<note place="margin">Sect. 5.</note> Enquiry, upon what <hi>occasion,</hi> and by what <hi>means</hi> and <hi>degrees,</hi> this <hi>difference</hi> betwixt what truly is, and what now is called, <hi>preaching the Gospel,</hi> came in?</p>
                     <p>And I say, the true and great occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this difference, is the different state of the Church. The alterations in the state hereof, since the Apostles departure out of the World, and the times immediately connecting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, have been so great, as have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred that Primitive preaching the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, both <hi>impossible</hi> and <hi>improper.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is first impossible, by reason of the cessation of that miraculous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible guidance of the Holy Ghost, which as it was not Universal then (for though the Apostles, and Prophets, and Evangelists generally had it, yet not all the Teachers of the Church, as we have seen) so it seems not to have been necessary in the Church any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:40528:341"/> than till the Canon of Scripture was finisht; the Church having that certainty now in these mate Records, which she had before from those living and vocal ones, the Apostles and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical men. We therefore confess in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously, we do not preach as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles did, because we cannot; and we cannot, because God hath not thought it fit or necessary to continue such a measure of his holy spirit upon particular persons, as he indulged them. In the mean while, as the present Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry are not accountable for having taught no better than they could, so neither are the people, for having been no better taught. The condemnation of this age will not be, for having been meanly instructed. Let the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as soundly, and live as holily as the Regular Ministry teacheth, and there is no fear of their miscarriage.</p>

Besides, we have seen it was various, occasional, interlocuto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which will not consist with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence due to the publick Worship of God in our Assemblies wherein we are to preach, nor even with the regard to be had to particular persons. For let any one judge, should we come, and in a short speech exhort people to turn Christians, and then give way to all the Questions, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Thus the great <hi>Occasion</hi> of this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is manifest; and withall appears to be such, as that it justifies or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants the difference which it hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and leaves not the blame there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of at the door of the present <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Sect: 6.</note> which have been used in what we call preaching, since this difference came in, they have been very various; and indeed they ought so to be. For it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our grand design to perswade men to the sincere practice of their Christian Duty, we must perswade them as we can, that is, as they will suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to be perswaded. And this ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifies our alteration of method, stile, and many other circumstances according to the temper and <hi>Genius</hi> of them, with whom we have to deal.

<pb n="633" facs="tcp:40528:342"/> is the most charitable construction we can put upon that great variation of the way of <hi>Preaching,</hi> which from time to time we cannot but observe to have been introduced and practised in all ages of the Church, as well ordinary as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary. For we shall find, that even in those inspired dayes, not onely the way of one Apostle's preaching dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered from anothers, but even upon different occasion, the same Apostle's from his own at other times. We will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with what certainly gave the first occasion, at least some precedent, to all such preaching as is now in use amongst us, and observe the difference all along.</p>
                     <p>Now that was certainly that kind of<note place="margin">Sect. 7.</note> interpreting Scriptures, which was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised by the Scribes and Doctors in the Old Jewish Church; which that we may see as particularly as we can, we will trace it from the very first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, or even appearances of any pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice tending thereto. I cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that by any letter of the Law, the <hi>Priests</hi> or <hi>Levites</hi> are commanded to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the people in the <hi>Law</hi> at their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Assemblies for Divine Worship, no

                        <q>—Furthermore (as after a while he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds) it was the solemn use, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what the <hi>Hebrews</hi> report, that at such time as the King read, and published the Law in the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Court, <hi>Levites</hi> appointed to this purpose, called together the people with Trumpets through all the City of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> and stirred up the whole multitude to the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Law: that being wrapt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to admiration by such solennity, they might begin more attentively to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and those, who were yet ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the matter, might more diligently inquire.</q> More he has to this effect. Herewith also agree Mr. <hi>Ainsworth</hi>'s Annotations. <q>This was, saith he, performed by the Chiefest of them, either the High Priest, as <hi>Ezra,</hi> or the King: For this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment was to <hi>Joshua</hi> (more right in that than <hi>Fagius,</hi> see <hi>ver.</hi> 7.) and therefore the King read it.—The King
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:40528:345"/> read sitting, and if standing, it was more commendable. He read from the beginning of <hi>Deuteronomy, &amp;c.</hi> They set up a great Pulpit of Wood in the midst of the Court-yard, and the King went up and sat therein, and all <hi>Israel</hi> gathered round about him. And the Minister of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue took the Book of the Law, and gave it to the ruler of the Synagogue: And the ruler of the Synagogue gave it to the <hi>Sagan</hi> or Captain of the Temple (<hi>Acts</hi> V. 24.) and the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> gave it to the High Priest, and the High Priest to the King, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him before the multitude. And the King took it standing, and if he would he sat down and read, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                        </q> More is to be had there, out of the Rabbies, of the particular Rites and Circumstances at this solemnity: but this is amply enough to our purpose. Now hereby it does not at all appear, that it was either the Duty, or the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome from the beginning of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, for the Priests or Levites so much as to read the Law to the people in their solemn Assemblies. And though
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:40528:345"/> it may be said, from <hi>Moses</hi> his <hi>writing</hi> this <hi>Law, and delivering it to the Priests the sons of</hi> Levi, <hi>which bare the Ark of the Covenant,</hi> that this his committing it to them, was in order to their read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to the people, yet this is <hi>Gratis dictum,</hi> and the reply is easie; he gave it to them as the Keepers of the <hi>Holy things,</hi> as they <hi>bore the Ark of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:</hi> and besides he gave it not to them alone, but also <hi>to all the Elders of</hi> Israel. The publick reading of the Law in the dayes of <hi>Joshua</hi> (Josh. <hi>VIII,</hi> 34.) was occasional: so too was that in the dayes of good <hi>Josiah,</hi> 2 Kings XXIII, 2. But in neither instance was it performed by the Levites, but, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what has been already spoken out of the late cited Authours, by the Chieftains of the people, <hi>Joshua,</hi> and <hi>Josiah</hi> themselves.

<pb n="654" facs="tcp:40528:353"/> took upon him to teach, wherein the Law came short of that more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Doctrine, which he came to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish. He brought to light a new and living way, avowing himself to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately sent from God to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, which the Jewish Doctours could not so much as pretend: and both by the concordance of his life, condition and doctrine with what the Prophets had taught, and by such miracles as had not been before heard of, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved what he said, that he was not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>prophet</hi> and inspired, but <hi>The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet which was to come,</hi> of whom both <hi>Moses and all the prophets</hi> had spoken. His stile or way of speech was free, but most praegnant and powerful, his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sublime, divine, and which by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinseck evidence approved it self to be from Heaven, not trashing humane life with slavish bodily observances, but advancing it to the greatest perfection of Virtue and inward Peace: his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of delivery with all assurance and Parrhesie, never at any loss, hallucina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or surprisal. When consulted on a sudden, he was the same (as much
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:40528:353"/> resolved in his own mind, and as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly satisfactory to all his Hearers in the answers he gave) as if he had Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought. In a word, whatever there was of rectitude or worth, either in the ordinary or extraordinary way of the Jewish preaching, we find, but most infinitely transcendent, in his. He seems to have stoopt so low, in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance on his prophetical discharge, as to have become some while a Reader. <hi>As his custome was, he went into the syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agogue</hi>

                        </gap>ias: and we find he <hi>opened it, and read.</hi> Having fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished his reading, he <hi>sat down,</hi> and, as we have seen the custome to have been amongst the Jewish Doctours, he <hi>interpreted</hi> that Scripture to them, but not as they; for he shewed it to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in himself: <hi>This day is this scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture fulfilled in your ears.</hi> And such was the evidence he gave hereof, that <hi>All who heard him bare witness, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at the gracious words, that procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of his mouth.</hi> As to the other kind of <hi>Ordinary</hi> preaching, in use a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:40528:354"/> the Jews, by resolving difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that arose, and informing mens consciences, Those who tried him with the hardest Questions which their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours malice could pick out to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found him, went away confounded themselves; and those, who out of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere purposes consulted him touching any point, wherein they wanted coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, found more satisfaction than they ever expected, and were surprised into a new and Heavenly life. The <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> preaching amongst the Jews, was that of the <hi>prophets,</hi> by virtue of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate inspiration; now whereas in all the prophets unto him, there was a certain stint of the spirit of Prophesie, some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars revealed, and infinitely more reserved (the <hi>spirit breathing</hi> in them <hi>when and how long it listed.</hi>) to Him <hi>God gave not the spirit by measure,</hi> John <hi>III,</hi> 34. He therefore did most infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and uncontroleably interpret scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, publish further the will of God, foretell future events, dispute, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, counsel, comfort, exhort, warn, <hi>reprove, rebuke with all authority.</hi> In fine, in his preaching did all kinds and
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:40528:354"/> parts of this Office, in the most accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plisht sort, concur.</p>
                     <p>Nor was the Apostles preaching much unlike to their Lords, by reason of their ample participation of the same spirit: onely some Footsteps of their different natural tempers, education, and former condition of life, might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be respectively discerned in their preaching, if we may judge (as to me seems just) of their way of speech, by their manner of writing. Thus much will any man of moderate insight into the different Characters of speech easily conclude, who shall take the paines to compare the Epistles of St. <hi>John,</hi> and St. <hi>James,</hi> and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and all of them with those of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> All their Sermons that we have extant, are comprised in the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles: Those generally agree with the account I have already given of them; namely, that they were discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses fram'd, as occasion offered, for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication or assertion of Christianity. To this purpose the main point they avow, is the Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, by which they prove him to
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:40528:355"/> have been the <hi>Messias,</hi> and his Doctrine from Heaven, and to require there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the belief and obedience of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. In this regard they had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in their subject different from that our Lord had: He onely foretold his resurrection, and gave it as a sign and proof that he was sent of God; they attest it as really come to pass, and publish this their testimony to the world. Besides, our Lord not going but to the <hi>lost sheep of the House of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> who already believed the true God, and the Oracles he had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, kept himself, as I may so speak, in a narrower compass of To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks, arguing chiefly either from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> and the Prophets Writings, or from his own Works, which he wrought in witness that his Father sent him: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, the Apostles being sent <hi>into all the World,</hi> to <hi>preach the Gospel to every creature,</hi> and being to convert men from idolatry, and perhaps Atheism<note place="margin">Act: XIII. &amp; XXVI. 22.</note> too, as well as from Judaism, took a larger scope as they saw occasion. Thus St <hi>Paul,</hi> when he has to do with the Jewes, urges onely <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi>
                        <pb n="659" facs="tcp:40528:355"/> and that he <hi>taught nothing but what they said should come to pass:</hi> yet when he is to preach at <hi>Athens,</hi> a place<note place="margin">Acts XVII: 18.</note> of Heathen literature, we hear nothing of <hi>Moses</hi> or prophets, though he had still, for the main, the same subject, <hi>Jesus and the Resurrection;</hi> but in order to the taking those people off from their idolatry, and bringing them to the Faith, he takes arguments out of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, and Philology too, as best suiting his Auditours Circumstances. So that, as beforesaid, we may reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly affirm, the very self same Apostles way of preaching differed much from his own at another time. We cannot see, but they took all occasions for all kind of teaching or preaching: Thus <hi>Philip</hi> preaches to the <hi>Ethiopian Eunuch,</hi> who was reading <hi>Isaiah,</hi> out of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> Act. VIII. 35. <hi>He opened his mouth, and began at that same scripture, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to him Jesus</hi> thence, interpreting no doubt that place of Jesus, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how it was verified in him. And it is very probable, St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Sermon to the Jewes in the Synagogue, <hi>after the reading the law and the prophets</hi> (Acts
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:40528:356"/> XIII. 16.) had the like foundation in the portions of the <hi>law and the prophets</hi> at that season read. At other times we shall find them not making set discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, but <hi>disputing</hi> and arguing. <hi>Act. IX.</hi> 29, and <hi>XVII.</hi> 17, and <hi>XIX.</hi> 9. Again at another time, not so much teaching or proving any thing new, but upon what was already known and believed, exhorting and stirring up to particular duties (<hi>Chap. XX. 28, &amp;c.</hi>) and as occasion required, intermixing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies, and foretelling future events, <hi>Ver.</hi> 29. In a word, as the Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Office was universal and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, so there is no ordinary kind of Ministring the word, belonging either to Pastour or Teacher, which we may not observe, or conceive, the Apostles to have practised, as occasion served; though still with the addition of what was extraordinary, and at present un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, as aforesaid.</p>
                     <p>Of what kind or frame their first<note place="margin">Sect 9.</note> Sermons in the Christian Church were, immediately after the cessation of those miraculous gifts spoken of, I know not whether any certain and distinct account
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:40528:356"/> can be given: It would seem they were onely brief Exhortations, made by the Bishops or Presidents above mentioned, immediately after the reading of the scriptures. Thus in that account given of the Christian Assemblies on the Lords Day by <hi>Justin Martyr.</hi>
                        <q>On the Lords Day called <hi>Sunday,</hi> saith he, all of us that live in the City or Villages about it, meet together in one place, and the Records of the Apostles, or the writings of the Prophets, are read, as the time will suffer.

Then at the presidents comn and, one of the Brethren went up into the Pulpit, and made a speech out of the received lives of the Saints, and holy scriptures, and the writings. of the Fathers, in a free and natural
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:40528:364"/> way, without Rhetorical colours or flourish. After him came up a second, and then a third, but each on a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent subject, and the last commonly treated of Ecclesiastical History, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating things in the Order of time as they were done. Each continued his Discourse half an hour, with great profit and delight of the Hearers; and then singing a Psalm, or Hymn, they went to prayers again and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Assembly.</q> This practice he conceives most neerly to resemble those Apostolical Assemblies spoken of in the <hi>XIV.</hi> of the first to the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> The way has taken much, they say, in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church: and truly those amongst us, who separate from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> seem very neerly to have imitated it (except in the particular of Church-History, which was too painful for them, &amp; of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten above their Learning) but that their prayers and discourses generally are of greater length.

                        <hi>preaching</hi> has attained, in the better part of the conformable English Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, such an height, beyond which it will not easily be improved, and to which, since the cessation of miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous gifts, it never arrived elsewhere.</p>
                     <p>These things <hi>I</hi> have thus freely spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,<note place="margin">Sect. 12</note> not out of any slighty opinion of the Antients; they were certainly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable in their age, and it is at a vast disadvantage that their Writings now come to us: yet, notwithstanding all disadvantages, are those very Writings a glorious light to us, and such with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we should be to seek, not onely in the Antient Rites, Customes, Laws &amp; Discipline of the Church, but in many points as to the true Antient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith; &amp; unable to defend the genuin Christianity against the pretences and, innovations, as well of <hi>Lesser</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever those ages may be conceived to be outdone by us, by reason of any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages we have above them, it is sure in the main they out did us: There
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:40528:365"/> was more sanctimony, true zeal, and singleness of heart to be found in one of them, than in an hundred of us; they <hi>Lived</hi> more Sermons than we <hi>Preach,</hi> and these were the greater excellencies. People might go to Heaven without scholastical notions, and Rhetorical or polite discourses, but they cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sincerity, resolution and holiness. Let therefore none think I have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the fifth Commandment, or go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in the least to detract from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence due to Antiquity: by speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freely of their way, I at once both acknowledge and vindicate their true worth. My design in any thing, which may seem to reflect upon them, is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to shew how variable a thing that which we call preaching is, and ever has been, since the proper and Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical preaching ceased; and so to bring people to a sober understanding that they may not, to the justling out of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the publick Worship, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-value Sermons, as admitting of more variation than any other office thereof: nor yet on the other side un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue them at present, this office
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:40528:366"/> in all ages of the Church having conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and being of divine institution; and the exercise of it in our Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advanced to so elevate a degree of eminence, as must be acknowledged.</p>
                     <p>Before I conclude this Head of the<note place="margin">Sect. 13</note> different Modes there have been of Preaching, there are one or two things which I think fit to add by way of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary.</hi> And first, that it is a little iniquitous to expect, that the whole essential frame and structure of our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons should be altered to such a degree of accuracy from what Sermons used to be, and what they still are otherwhere, not without vast pains and industry on our sides, and yet generally to require such inconsiderable circumstances, which are to the auditours (except they will be humoursome) indifferent, but would be to us of great ease. should still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main the same. As to what of Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals we deliver, we must, all points con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted on both hands being weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, state maturely, prove demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, refute convictively; and in the Applicatory part we must perswade passionately, and as far as we can o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:40528:366"/> nothing which may move the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest concernment: and two such Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourses at least, each of an hour long, we must bring forth every Week, which we are content to do; But after we have framed them with our utmost care, and perhaps know not how to alter or omit a sentence for advantage, if we do not like School-boyes say all by heart, we are censured as lazy; and this because the Antients perhaps, and most Forreigners (who generally take not that pains in ten Sermons, which many of us do in one) use so to do. Now I am bold with submission to say, this circumstance of reading or not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, is indifferent to the Auditory: for suppose a man pronounce well, and as he ought, what matters it to those that hear him, whether his Book be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen or shut, in his hand or in his poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket? We are commanded to read the prayers, and they are not supposed therefore to affect less; where then is the disadvantage in decent reading our Sermons? But though this matter sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie nothing at all to any s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ber Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, yet, I say, it signifies much to the
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:40528:367"/> preacher: it frees him from terrour, confusion, and perpetual anxiety, while he is speaking; besides, that it saves him before a great deal of preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous time, which might be otherwise well spent, and which, it may be, he can ill afford from his other spiritual cares. To speak ingenously, and as the case stands: Account has been given what the old Preaching was; Give us that their <hi>Old</hi> liberty, or give us the <hi>New</hi> liberty which some men take, we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read, nay possibly, many of us need not study. What man so barren, who could not run a loose descant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Gospel in the Morning for a quarter or half an hour; and do as much by the Epistle, it may be, in the Afternoon? Or, who could not cut of such Text as he pleaseth to choose, deduce empty Doctrines, and give them needless proofs; and then while out as empty an Application? But if in stead of a quarter of an hours roveing discourse, or such longer tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling, as insinuated, there be expected from us a solid Divinity-lecture of an Hour long, and not onely the <hi>Teachers</hi>
                        <pb n="683" facs="tcp:40528:367"/> or Catechists, but the <hi>pastors</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicatory part too (in a manner a just Treatise) and these so often, truly those, who read such Sermons, may be pardoned if they do thereby offend, seeing the offence is onely by too much care not to offend. In a word, if we may not read, we must be more bold with our Hearers, and less accurate in our provisions: we must put in practice his rule,</p>

<pb n="684" facs="tcp:40528:368"/> desing'd for that, in what they call <hi>preaching the Word:</hi> nay, so highly do they magnifie their labours in that kind, that they call their very <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> the <hi>Word of God</hi> in their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary language. I do admire indeed, as <hi>I</hi> have said, a multitude of our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Sermons; but <hi>I</hi> would never equal the best of them, to that which seems the meanest part of Holy scripture, nor allow them the name due onely to the divine Oracles. It is evident by what has been said, we cannot pretend to such preaching, as was that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles: we must not therefore give our Sermons those names, which theirs both had and deserved; which is the other point I would add by way of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary. Let us but have so much so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety and reason as not to contradict our selves, but be consistent with our own principles: We deny infallibility to the Pope and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and for most just reasons; And shall we each in terms assume it to our private selves, when we deny it to a Church? We do assume it, if we call our Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <hi>Gospel,</hi> or our Sermons the <hi>Word
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:40528:368"/> of God:</hi> they are at best but comments or Tractates upon it. The Fathers, and the Primitive Church have ever contented themselves with the more modest appellations of <hi>Homilies</hi> and Sermons, and them not God's, but theirs who made them. It may be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally observed, those men, who most confidently thus arrogate to their preaching, have as little reasons for this high style thereof, as any men: but whether we have or we have not, it certainly becomes us to imitate the Fathers, at least in their humility, and to speak as the Catholick Church ever had done. And thus of the different modes of preaching, and their occasions.</p>

For it is necessary, both that some one else (and him duly commissioned) judge of such persons abilities, (no Law ever allowing any man to be sole

                     <p>And some kind of outward Call, all, who have had any grain of sobriety, have ever acknowledged necessary: Even <hi>Zuinglius</hi> himself (whatever is<note place="margin">Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastes Oper.

<pb n="695" facs="tcp:40528:373"/> him on his own head, except so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved<note place="margin">Fol 52. <hi>a.</hi>

                        <q>There seems nothing so agreeable to the Divine Ordinance and instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as that the whole Assembly of any faithful people, together with some godly and learned Bishops, or other faithful men skilful in holy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, choose to themselves a Pastor:</q> so that it is apparent, he did not reject all outward Call as necessary (for this in the general he contends stiffly for) but his errour was in the misplacing it, in accounting the choice of the people, taking to their assistance <hi>some learned and godly Bishops, or like prudent men,</hi> to be a due outward Call, without any
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:40528:374"/> other Ordination. But this, however much practised by the Independents (saving onely that they would have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with Bishops, though never so godly or learned) has been generally rejected as an errour and grand schism, and indeed is so: it will be necessary therefore to consider further, what this outward Call is, and to whom it belongs to confer it.</p>
                     <p>I have above proved out of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epistles, that the Apostles did choose, out of such persons as they had ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, some one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>That this power was committed to
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:40528:376"/> meer Presbyters can never be proved.

Whether the <hi>Prophets</hi> or Teachers in the Primitive Church, received any other Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but that of Deacons (that is, of being assistants to the Bishops) seems very questionable; and truly, I should rather determine it in the Negative, for that we find both St. <hi>Stephen</hi> and St. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip,</hi> who were then certainly onely<note place="margin">Act▪ VII. &amp; VIII.</note> Deacons, to have been eminent in this way.

<pb n="701" facs="tcp:40528:376"/> Presbyters never received the power of Ordination: for, having it not from the Apostles, because they are supposed an Order not in being in their times, that they had it not from the succeeding Bishops, is evident from the eldest Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons we have. <hi>Apost.

                        <q>It would seem, that if all the Bishops were dead together, priests of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour order (<hi>viz.</hi> presbyters) might or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain Bishops:</q> that is, they might choose out of themselves an ordained person, a presbyter, whom they might conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate or set apart as Bishop: but he does not say, they might ordain a person, that never was ordained, though that may be acknowledged as a consectary thence. I must therefore say still, that I want an express antient autho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rity for this doctrine, even in case of necessity. And it is very considerable, God from the beginning never suffered the Christian Church to be reduced to this Necessity, which possibly is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that the case was not of old more narrowly sifted and determined.</p>
                     <p>But though to deal sincerely, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find such antient authority, yet I do see some reason, which may plead
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:40528:383"/> for it. It is certain (1) Necessity does many times warrant those violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of positive Laws, which it enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth: it is not so indeed in Natural Laws, the obligation of which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no necessity can take off. We know who taught us, I <hi>will have mercy and not sacrifice.</hi> Rather than have no Sacraments, no publick Worship, no Order in the Church, uncanonical Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination (by sole presbyters <hi>I</hi> mean) might be admitted, which I conceive to be the case of divers of the Forreign Reformed Churches, and it may be was the case of some particular persons amongst us, in the end of our late Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Wars. And (2) though it be true, <hi>Nil dat quod non habet,</hi> yet there seems some natural reason, that a man may confer the power, that he has. The main power then that presbyters pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, being that of administring the Sacraments, preaching, and otherwise officiating in the publick Worship, and there being, no doubt, but generally all presbyters at their Ordination, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this power, what should hinder, but they may convey or propagate it,
<pb n="715" facs="tcp:40528:383"/> that is, ordain Presbyters? If any say Canonical Sanction hinders, I allow it, and both acknowledge, &amp; have proved, regularly they cannot; because though they rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ved power to minister as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bovesaid, yet not power of themselves to transmit or confer on others such power. Yet forasmuch as the power of governing the Church, our Lord Jesus being departed out of the World, devolved regulary to his Apostles, whom he had appointed, and the same power, after the decease of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, devolved to the Bishops whom they had ordained, so put the case (which <hi>Armacha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And that the rather, because as the true Church is by the promise of Christ to continue to the end of the World, and he has obliged himself so long to <hi>be with
<pb n="716" facs="tcp:40528:384"/> it,</hi> so he being supposed by such extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the superiour Order, to have providentially cast the supreme propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative power in Spirituals upon such Presbyters, at least within such Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories or parts of the World, who shall say (admitting still that they profess, believe and teach [<hi>quod ubique, quod semper, quod ab omnibus</hi>] the true an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Catholick Faith, and are publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desirous of that antient regular Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which through the fate of their cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, they cannot attain) who I say shall implead these men, that they violate the orders and appointments of Christ Jesus? This, <hi>I</hi> say again, I take to be the case of most of the Forreign Reformed Churches: they do strictly for the main, hold the true Catholick Faith; they had very few of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopal Order (in many parts none) who would admit the Reformation, or ordain any who would not abjure it; the Order therefore thus amongst them became morally extinct: they were and are, as far as their circumstances will admit, desirous of the regular Unity and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="718" facs="tcp:40528:385"/> them as Bishops, yield them their due jurisdiction, and both attribute Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to them, and without refuseall take it from them: The same thing which both I alwaies, and Dr. <hi>Luther</hi> himself very often, both by word of mouth and in writeing, nay and in publick sermons in the Cathedrall Church of <hi>Mersburg,</hi> have protested and promised:</q> This is not to throw our Protestant Reformed Bishops, to make head, even after their restaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, against their power, and to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose ordination from them, contrary to the Lawes of the Catholick Church, and even of our own Kingdome.</p>
                     <p>To come then to an issue in short: I say no man in these Realms can make out a <hi>Call</hi> to the Ministry who at least has not received <hi>Episcopall Ordination.</hi> The necessity of an outward call has been already evidenced, and more much might be said, that an inward call Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth not: For though a man were sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed sufficiently assured in his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, to warrant his own practice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, yet except there be some outward testimony of this mission, man,

Besides that all along, <hi>The works which he did, testified of him.</hi> Now, such a Call as this, none now adayes can pretend. Those therefore, who will prove their Mission from God, must be content to own it to be from him <hi>mediately, viz.</hi> by the Ministry of men authorised by God. Now, God having committed <hi>all power into the hands of Christ,</hi> none can conwey this power of Ministry, but those who have it from Christ and
<pb n="720" facs="tcp:40528:386"/> his Apostles, and their successours duly sent. And then, according to the constant Doctrine of the Holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, evidently founded on Scripture, no persons otherwise ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (except haply in case of inevitable necessity) than by Bishops, can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to an outward Call. It will not avail our dissenters to say, they were necessitated to accept such irregular or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, (which, according to the Doctrine of the Catholick Church, I have said to be null) for they may have their imperfect ordination compleated, or be regularly ordained, if they please. It will not suffice them to say, they have as good an outward Call as the Ministry in the Forreign Churches: for in diverse of them they have Bishops; in others where they have not the <hi>name,</hi> they have the <hi>thing;</hi> and where they have neither, they have a <hi>necessity,</hi> in a manner <hi>invincible,</hi> to plead for this irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity. In a word, our men have not so much of an outward Call, as we have seen even <hi>Zwinglianism</hi> it self avowes necessary; they cannot say they were <hi>chosen by the people with the approbation
<pb n="721" facs="tcp:40528:386"/> of godly Bishops.</hi> Nay, they have not so much of an outward Call, as <hi>Erastus</hi> himself would allow of: They are not chosen by the people with the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Magistrate; our King, both by his Laws and Proclamations, interdicting this their pretended Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry. There being then none of the antient, none of present Reformed Churches, whose Doctrine or practice will own this practice of theirs, they hereby cut themselves off, from the Body of Christ; and how they will escape the grievous guilt of Schism, if my words would signifie any thing, I would beseech them in the fear of God, and with tender regard to their own souls, and the souls of such whom they draw into Schism with them, that they would consider.</p>
                     <p>But besides the sin of Schism, I fear they may, when they please to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial, find some farther guilt in this their practice: For having no due Call to the Ministry, they are <hi>intruders</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that sacred Office; intruders too (generally) upon a double account▪ First, as usurping the Office: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

<pb n="723" facs="tcp:40528:387"/> theirs?

Upon these Principles how can they forbid Papists, Anabaptists, Quakers, and all like sorts, to do dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the same to them, they do to us? Nay, do not these people, upon the same reasons, every day do the same to them? And how can they condemn those who <hi>mete by their own measures?</hi> It is<note place="margin">Of the Church l. 3. c. 39.</note> truly, and most reasonably, stated by Learned Dr. <hi>Field,</hi> that there are <q>Three things implied in the calling of
<pb n="724" facs="tcp:40528:388"/>Ecclesiastical Ministers. First, An Election or Designment of persons fit for so high and excellent imploiment.</q> Secondly, <q>The consecrating of them, and giving them power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to intermeddle with things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the service of God. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the assigning and dividing to each man thus sanctified, that porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods people which he is to taken care of.</q> And it is certain, both from scripture and antiquity, that the Apostles of Christ, and their immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate successours, commonly so divided those whom they had converted, that each City, and the places adjoining, made up but one Church. Now this assignation intitleing then the <hi>Pastours</hi> to their Flocks, should any in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles dayes have come from another City, and intermeddled in a City as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to others (from <hi>Ephesus</hi> suppose to <hi>Corinih</hi>) and out of the Faithful there, under pretence of greater gifts, or a purer way, gathered a particular Church, and set up a way of Worship in opposition to that maintained by the regular Ministry of that Church, would
<pb n="725" facs="tcp:40528:388"/> not this have been then adjudged both a <hi>schism,</hi> and an <hi>intrusion?</hi> Or could such New-comer, because several peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple followed him, and preferred his Ministry, avow he had a due call to the Ministry in such place? Admit but this practice lawfull, and withall but suppose, that in a multitude there are some giddy, and not a few taken with Novelties, and there will be no end of divisions. And this is plainly the case betwixt the Non-conforming Preachers and our selves. In summe then, these pretenders to a <hi>necessity of preaching,</hi> having no call, neither to the Office (most of them) nor (any) to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of it where they do exercise it, Reason &amp; justice are so far from allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any necessity to lye upon them to preach, in the present sense, that if they would, all circumstances conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, duly apply the Text of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in stead of saying, <hi>Wo be to us if we preach not,</hi> they ought to say, <hi>Wo be to us if</hi> (in these circumstances) <hi>we preach;</hi> as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the bounds of our <hi>Calling,</hi> and at once transgressing the rules of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, in doing otherwise than we would
<pb n="704" facs="tcp:40528:389"/> be done by, and together the Laws of God, of the Catholick Church, of this Church, and of the Realm.</p>
                     <p>But they will say, they are bound in<note place="margin">

                     <p>This is but the same thing over again in other words, and to give it likewse an answer over again in other words: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, or the practical judgment, when it acts contrary to, or besides its rule, is not conscience, but imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, erroneous conceit, arrogance, or obstinacy, as the case stands: It is plain by the premisses, that the rule in this case dictates the contrary, and therefore there can be no sound process of Conscience in the matter; what there is of the Evils taxed, it concerns them who are guilty, respectively to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                     <pb n="727" facs="tcp:40528:389"/>
                     <p>More particularly, as to the points pretended to oblige conscience; We would perswade none, who have given themselves up to God for the service of his Church in the Ministry, to revoke their own act; let them serve therein as they are capable: but then let them <hi>enter by the door,</hi> and not, by <hi>climbing</hi> in some indirect <hi>way,</hi> be so injurious to themselves, as to draw on themselves the guilt of being <hi>thieves</hi> and <hi>robbers.</hi> Oh! how willingly would we seethem regular Preachers, reforming and reducing the schisms they have been guilty of making, or accessory to, and drawing in the same yoke with our selves! What joy would it be to us, what comfort to themselves one day, and what benefit at present to the Church, for them to employ their parts and zeal, to peace, unity, charity and true Christianity! But this can never be done by the course they take: <hi>They that gather not with us, scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter abroad.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then, as to meer popular Election intitleing them to the care of such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular portions of the Flock of Christ, and so making a Call, this pretence is
<pb n="728" facs="tcp:40528:390"/> partly false, partly schismatical. If we should come to a <hi>Poll</hi> in the parishes where they preach, they would not have in most places, one fourth, in diverse, not one tenth man: I am mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest in the account. But they are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen by those by whom they are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, and so they are intitled to these. Such popular Election, I say, is schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical, and 'tis already proved such. For either these men themselves, or their predecessors, seduced the people from their lawful Pastours into such privy Assemblies, and this made the schism: and the schism being thus made, to accept of the choice of such a people, and, by virtue of it, to head them, is to maintain and propagate the schism.</p>
                     <p>The same too is to be said touching any Church Covenant, as they call it, entred into by such pretended Pastour and Flock. And let it be judged whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if any, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>or all these pretences, would make up a due Call, all Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and Sectaries in the world, who have but any numbers, might not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow the same. And what end, I say, can there then be of Confusion, Division,
<pb n="729" facs="tcp:40528:390"/> and <hi>every evil work?</hi> It is plain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the pretence of meer conscience upon these or like grounds, is most fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous, and would serve any the most erroneous, schismatical, or Enthusia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick parties in the world.</p>
                     <p>But some, possibly, may say, if<note place="margin">Sect. 8.</note> Ordination by sole Presbyters be valid in any case, why not in all? The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons ordaining being supposed still of the same Order, why should not the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue &amp; efficacy be still the same? Now, the validity of Presbyters ordaining, has been acknowledged in the case of some; and more cases may be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in which, necessity may press as much: As, suppose some Presbyters (or even private Christians) were cast on an Heathen Island, where, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of time they converted the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants to the Faith, but could come at no Bishop who might ordain a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent number of Ministers, nor even suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors for themselves; might not these Priests lawfully ordain others, and should not such Ordination be valid? And allowing this, that such Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be to the persons so ordained, a
<pb n="730" facs="tcp:40528:391"/> good and effectual outward Call to the Ministry, how can it be said in other cases, that those who were sent by sole Presbyters, which are still of the same order and power, have not a like good and effectual Call, and so, as much <hi>necessity lying</hi> on them <hi>to preach?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To the Objection, <hi>I</hi> say, No man, that I know, ever accounted Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on valid, upon any supposal of certain <hi>internal qualifications</hi> or virtues thereby imparted. If the validity thereof did ly meerly in some such supposed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, it were true, admitting these Communications to be still the same (as there is little reason not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it) it were true, I say, that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination from Presbyters being valid in case of Necessity, would be valid also otherwise; the persons, at least, the Order, and consequently the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications being the same. But all, that Ordination confers, is a <hi>Power to offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in holy</hi> things; now to the confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of such a Power, it is evidently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, that he who confer it, have himself received power to confer it (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise his act is null): And this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="731" facs="tcp:40528:391"/> he must have, either in Ordinary method and due regular course, or by some extraordinary means; of which, besides Revelation, I know none as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signable, but invincible Necessity. Now, though perhaps no man will say, that such Necessity puts any <hi>new inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal virtues</hi> into any <hi>Office,</hi> yet, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, it cannot reasonably be denied, but that it casts a <hi>lawful power</hi> in many cases upon men, which otherwise they would not have; namely, it invests them with that <hi>Right,</hi> which by <hi>Law Positive</hi> they have not.</p>
                     <p>Now, as to the particular case put, for the corroborating the Objection: Touching such Priests (nay, even such private Christians, if it should so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen) thus necessitated to ordain, it might rationally be said <hi>The seal of their</hi>

In express terms, their local separation from all Bishops, joined with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of their success, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially constitute them Bishops (or
<pb n="732" facs="tcp:40528:392"/> more) at least impower them to Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopal acts for the present Necessity, if not invest them with a right to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side in, and govern those Churches, as the Apostles (several of them) did the Churches which were of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version. But there are two things here to be noted: First, that this provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence would as truly impower Lay-men to ordain, as Presbyters; and so it helps not▪ all those with whom we have to do. And secondly, 'tis worthy to be remembred, that this is an <hi>imaginary case,</hi> which is not known, as far as I can understand, to have come to pass. St. <hi>Philip</hi> indeed (we will suppose the Deacon) converted <hi>Samaria,</hi> but no fate or Necessity precluded his recourse to the Apostles at <hi>Jerusalem;</hi> and S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and S. <hi>John</hi> were sent down to the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Church for the regular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution thereof. <hi>Socrates</hi> also reports,<note place="margin">Eccl: Histor: lib: 1. c▪ 15.</note> that <hi>Aedesius</hi> &amp; <hi>Frum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, on all hands, our Ministerial pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is secure.

                     <p>But I shall too far digress: The summe is, it is apparent, that as to our most clamorous pretenders to a <hi>Necessity of preaching,</hi> and to a tender dread of a <hi>Wo to them if they preach not,</hi> in the present sense, as to all I mean, who are not called to the Ministry as before stated, the case is directly contrary; They ought not in these circumstances to preach, they sin in diverse regards in so doing; and, I hope, they will not in express terms aver, they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Necessity of living in a course of known sin: Their pretences for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, against our Church, their cries
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:40528:396"/> for that order which there is in other Reformed Churches, are so far from being just, that we have all reason to admire and adore the singular favour of God towards our Church in its happy regularity above others: and if they would have reformed according to the <hi>Pattern of the best Reformed Church</hi> in being, they ought not to have altered the constitution of ours, but conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves thereunto.</p>
                     <p>It will be said now, Does there then<note place="margin">Sect. 10,</note> ly a <hi>Necessity</hi> upon all who are <hi>duly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> to <hi>preach.</hi> So that <hi>Wo be to them if they preach not,</hi> as now we take Preaching?</p>
                     <p>Before this can be directly answered, there must be two considerables premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. First, that there being <hi>diversities of Gifts,</hi> and <hi>diversities of Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> all men are not by their very Ordination, designed to the same part or kind of Ministring. We have seen it was not so even in the very Primitive dayes: All <hi>Elders</hi> that <hi>ruled well,</hi> did not notwithstanding <hi>labour in the Word and Doctrine.</hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>esides, it has been made evident, that the name <hi>Preaching</hi>
                        <pb n="741" facs="tcp:40528:396"/> is now become a Term of Art, and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifies with us, what <hi>Tractare</hi> did with the <hi>Latine</hi> Fathers, to make in publick a kind of Commentary, with occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Exhortations and Applications, on some Text of Scripture, or to instruct the Faithful on some particular subject: now this is not the same with bare pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the Gospel, or the old and proper Preaching. All in Orders have authority to preach, or publish the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, by <hi>publick solemn reading</hi> of it; but all have not authority to make thereon publick <hi>comments</hi> of their own. This difference is intimated in the very <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Ordination.</hi> To the <hi>Deacon</hi> it is said, <hi>Take thou Authority to read the Gospel in the Church of God, and to preach the same, if thou be licensed thereto by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop himself.</hi> But to the Priest, <hi>Take thou authority to preach the Word of God, and to administer the Sacraments,</hi> &amp;c. It is very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from Antiquity, that Preaching, in the present sense, was long reserved as a peculiar of the Bishop (<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="742" facs="tcp:40528:397"/> us, it is still in the Eastern Church. But yet that it was earlily required of the Presbyters, we have already seen out of the pretended Apostolical Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;<note place="margin">Rit▪ Conc. lib. 2. c. 1.</note> and <hi>Ferrarius</hi> has many more au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, to which I refer the Reader.

                     <p>Secondly, All who have received
<pb n="743" facs="tcp:40528:397"/> power to preach, are not to exercise it at liberty where they please, but in the places assigned to them. This is again apparent by the very Form of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination: <hi>Take thou Authority to preach, &amp;c. in the Congregation where thou shalt be lawfully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed thereto.</hi> God is not the <hi>God of Confusion, but of Order;</hi> and <hi>The spirit of the Prophets are subject to the spirits of the Prophets.</hi> Preachers may often hear as well as preach, and it will as well become them (<hi>in loco</hi>) in place and time convenient. By the Lawes of the Church, Men are not generally or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained without Titles (The Antients held all such Ordinations void) And being ordained, they are appointed to exercise their Ministry in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular places, to which they are limited, within such a sphere, and at times and seasons allowed. Men must not <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="744" facs="tcp:40528:398"/> wholesome Rules of Polity require.</p>
                     <p>These things being thus premised, I say, Every <hi>Minister</hi> who is <hi>called to</hi>

But in common language we do not call these preaching: however they will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood to be comprehended under that term, <hi>Due attendance on other parts of our Ministry.</hi> Now, <hi>I</hi> say, these being supposed done, I conceive every Minister, as far as his abilities will bear, bound ordinarily to preach upon all Licit, and usual opportunities. For it seems plain to me, that Divine injunctions and precedents, interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by parity of reason, thus far reach us.</p>
                     <p>Further, Secondly, though much might<note place="margin">Sect. 12.</note> be said, and something suddenly shall, touching the need of preaching (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever some are pleased to think) yet at
<pb n="747" facs="tcp:40528:399"/> present we will onely say, Whether it be really needful, or not, does not much vary the case; it is sufficient to make it necessary that the people think it so, and will not generally be satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without its frequency. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Reformation, as there was much need of <hi>preaching,</hi> by reason of the gross ignorance the people had been long kept in, so there was all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence used to procure and set it up e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where, as much and as often as the state of the age would bear; and this vastly furthered the protestant Cause: Now people will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, but the Armes which got us the <hi>victory,</hi> are still fit for our <hi>defence;</hi> what at first promoted so much the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion, is a proper and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural mean to maintain it, and give it all advantages. We see there is scarce any publick Office of Religion, that the greater part of men amongst us would not rather part with, than Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Let every one of us please his neighbour for his good to edification: For even Christ pleased not himself.</hi> The same was our Apostles Practice as well as Doctrine, <hi>I am all things to all men, if by any means I might save some.</hi> Both<note place="margin">1.

And sure we cannot think our selves wiser than these so great Masters in gaining souls. But admit it were not our duty by so great labours, as our frequent preaching comes to, to comply with the weaker sort, who think it needful perhaps when it is not, yet still, except we think the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                     <pb n="749" facs="tcp:40528:400"/>
                     <p>A third Argument then which may evince the Necessity lying on us thus frequently to preach, is not onely the expectation, but the condition and real needs of our people, the several wants they are under. Now to make this as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as <hi>I</hi> can in a few words: I say there is no sort of people amongstus whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but have need thereof more or less. I will for our present occasion distinguish our people a little otherwise than I did towards the close of my first Discourse.</p>
                     <p>We may look on the <hi>multitude</hi> as made up of three sorts of men; Of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons settled in some profession of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion upon <hi>rational</hi> grounds and induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Of many m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> of <hi>passion</hi> or <hi>interest,</hi> but in truth unset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in any, and Of a far greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber who are indeed <hi>indifferent</hi> to all professions, and if they are addicted to one more than another, it is onely because the stream now carries them that way. To each of these it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear upon consideration, that our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Preaching is needful.</p>
                     <p>As to the first, those I mean, who
<pb n="750" facs="tcp:40528:401"/> have addicted themselves to some one profession of Religion out of a rational choice; the choice these men have made, is either right or wrong. If they have chosen, and are serious in the true Religion (which sort of men God knows we must lament, is far the fewest) yet is Preaching in the sense we take it, needful even to those, <hi>to stip up their pure minds by way of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</hi> They do not need it may be<note place="margin">2. pet: 3. 1.</note> so long Sermons, because <hi>they know these things;</hi> but they do need frequent and moving ones, because humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is subject to inadvertency, dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and forgetful security. The best men find reason to complain of dead hearts; &amp; besides, <hi>he that thinketh he s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>elable) ones in these regards: they call home the rangeing soul, they six the uncomposed, they quicken the dull, they awaken and raise up those who are faln, they strengthen those who stand, and call all to their watch. But if any on the other side are mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in their choice, and seem rati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="751" facs="tcp:40528:401"/> settled in a bad way (as there are too many who can argue shrewdly for their errours) there is to these much more need of preaching, to unsettle them first, and then to fix them aright: which perhaps being a difficult and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Work, will require more labour, and longer and frequenter contention of discourse, both in publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, than some who have not very fresh experience in these things will easily imagine.</p>
                     <p>Now for the second sort, men who have a passionate zeal for some one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but are truth ungrounded, and not well perswaded of the truth of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in general: The present age abounds with such. Interests and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions are strangely conjoined and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven by almost inextricable intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glements: and as mens interest leads them, they are zealous for this or that way or profession, not indeed that it is Religion it self, which at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome they are concern'd for, but their interest being complicate therewith, they cannot pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="752" facs="tcp:40528:402"/> their zeal &amp; noise to the more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deble object, Religion. Now how great need there is, and what vast and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate pains it will require to work these people to a sense of God and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual goods, to bring them to prefer Faith and good Conscience, before their <hi>Nets</hi> and their <hi>Drags,</hi> before their gain or craft, cannot easily be estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: certainly a more effectual means than Preaching will not be found.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, as to the indifferent multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, who are alwayes of the Religion of the State, that these are not to be neglected, forasmuch as God has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly many people amongst them, which first or last may be brought in, and that there is no way of effecting this, so likely as Preaching, because this being in fashion, this they will fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, who sees not?

And which was the worst of all, notwithstanding those injunctions in the Canons in express terms, touching weekly Sermons, it is too sure, that in the times alledged, there was not such observance of those Canons as there ought to havebeen. In some hundreds of private Countrey-pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes, they had not four Sermons a year: But now for the main, in all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish-Churches, we have generally at least one Sermon each Lords Day, and in the larger Parishes two; besides others occasionally on solemn Festivals, or the like dayes: which is more than those Lawes prescribed, and yet we have seen they prescribed more than was practised.</p>

In this state of things, those few of the honest regular Clergy, that made a shift (though not without a great deal of persecution) to keep their Livings, observing the weapons used against them, doubled their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and would not be out-preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their adversaries, but were as frequently in the Pulpit on the Lords Day, and all due seasons, as any of them, and to much better purpose; they sowed <hi>wheat,</hi> while the others onely threw abroad <hi>tares.</hi> This also gave occasion to all the serious and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant Students in the Universities, who designed the Ministry, to bend their Divinity-studies towards preaching e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially, which they saw now was to be much their frequenter Work, than it had been formerly their predecessors: And afterwards, when by degrees the whimsies of the age begun to evaporate, those lately so famed Gifts, being grown

<pb n="763" facs="tcp:40528:407"/> the present frequency of Preaching to have so much prevailed of late years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us.</p>
                     <p>Now as to the benefit hereof, it has been and is, greater than perhaps I am able to give account of.

Besides, our <hi>Clergy</hi> consisting in a manner wholely of Preachers, are much better able, on all occasions, to <hi>maintain discourse</hi> in some commendable sort with <hi>gainsayers</hi> of all parties, &amp; vindicate the Truth, the Church and Themselves from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and unjust censures they meet with, than formerly many of them were: and they are further put upon a kind of necessity of daily <hi>improving</hi> their abilities, with which I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, but their <hi>zeal</hi> and resolution for Godliness must also grow: For though a man may read over an Homily, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being affected therewith, yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

                     <p>To come then closer to the main<note place="margin">Sect. 4.</note> point: However slighty opinion some may have of preaching, who are cloi'd with abundance, and will long admire nothing but what is rare, the change would soon appear dismal, were <hi>Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers removed into corners,</hi> or those li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Oracles by any other means with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn.

                     <p>I lay here for a foundation, that<note place="margin">Sect. 5.</note> That which keeps the face of Religion more bright and glorious in our <hi>English</hi> Church, than perhaps in any other, is very much our <hi>stricter observation of the Lords Day,</hi> and our <hi>frequenter preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> thereon, than possibly is usual in Forreign Churches. We come not from the Church on <hi>Sundayes</hi> (and haply from the Communion too) to the Market, nor buy there our dinners, and go then to eat them in the next Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern we can get them drest in. At least on this Day (generally) we keep home, and see (most of us) that our Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, do so too. And, as from Church
<pb n="769" facs="tcp:40528:410"/> we go gravely home to our private and modest necessary refreshments, so, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, soberly to Church again.

At present, that which I am concern'd for is this, that this Observation of the Lords Day mainly keeps up the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, aw, and spiritual Grandieur of Religion amongst us; and the reason I give for it is, that I can assign nothing, which we have, that is not common to us with our Neighbours, or in which, perhaps, we are not outdone by them, whereto I can ascribe this effect, that the generality of our people, of all ages, sexes and conditions, are more religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously given, and seem to have a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er sense of Religion, than is said other Nations have, save our more religious keeping of this day. Have we the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures? so have they. Have we pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in our Mother-tongue? So have all the Reformed Churches. Have we Ecclesiastical Discipline? Those Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in their way are as strict, or stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter than our selves. Is there some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of outward decency, beauty and
<pb n="772" facs="tcp:40528:412"/> glory in our publick Worship? As to state, how far are we outdone by the Papists! I must therefore attribute this effect to no other Cause. Now <hi>I</hi> say further, 'Tis our Sermons that keep up the observation of the Lords-day. We can get people to church twice on the day, and keep them there too, and have full Congregations, if we so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten preach diligently to them: we should not, did we do otherwise. Some will be on <hi>Afternoons</hi> in the <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house</hi> or <hi>Taverns,</hi> others at publick <hi>games</hi> and <hi>sports,</hi> others otherwise imploied, or not imploied, if we be not in the <hi>Pulpit:</hi> not one in twenty, who now come duly to Church, would then be there.</p>
                     <p>But I am not ignorant, that this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice<note place="margin">Sect. 6.</note> of the <hi>Afternoon Sermons</hi> on the Lords-day, lies under no good repute with some men, who pretend to be great friends, and sons too, of our Church. The best name they can give it is, a <hi>Novelty,</hi> introduced by <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish puritan Overdoo</hi>'s. I heartily grieve, if indignation will suffer me, when I hear such language, especially from men
<pb n="773" facs="tcp:40528:412"/> that call themselves <hi>Protestants,</hi> and pretend not onely <hi>Devotion</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> to be dear to them, but that they have searched <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and find no foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps of this use there, nor any place for the Afternoon-Sermon in any Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, or even in our Present Liturgies.

                     <p>
                        <hi>I</hi> must acknowledge, in the first set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of Christianity, we are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to observe this practice; for they assembled for Divine Worship every day, and communicated too: nor can we think, their Communions were without Exhortations, as well as Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; they preached then possibly every day. And when their more solemn Assemblies came to be fixt, as soon they were, chiefly on the Lords-day (<hi>Acts XX,</hi> 7.) it would seem they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued from the time of their meeting, till the Evening, or sometimes (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they met) till the Break of day, or other occasion, dissolved them, no one going home to eat, and then
<pb n="774" facs="tcp:40528:413"/> returning to the Assembly; for that all generally brought somewhat with them, and a common Table or Meal was an appendance of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.

                     <p>These Authorities both of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers, and of this great Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, may suffice to convince the world,

I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, Where did these <hi>Fathers</hi> find it? It is sure they preached publickly in the Afternoon-Assemblies. But suppose it had no place at all <hi>in the body</hi> of any Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies, suppose it immediately <hi>succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> the Evening▪ Office, as commonly it does in our present use, where is the inconvenience or <hi>irregularity?</hi> It is not at all repugnant unto our Act of <hi>Ʋniformity.</hi> But if any will have a place for it in the Liturgy, why may it not properly enough come in after the <hi>second Lesson?</hi> The Custome we have seen of old was, to handle some part of what had been read; and when more naturally, than immediately after the reading or Lessons? Our Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes that to be the season for Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chising Youth: We will suppose, due Catechising is not a bare hearing Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren repeat the words of the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism, but explaining, asserting and
<pb n="783" facs="tcp:40528:417"/> applying the Doctrine thereof in a plain and familiar manner. Suppose our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon-Sermons in our Parish-Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches such (as is most fit they should be) and do we not find a proper room for them in our present Liturgy? Such handling any Catechetical point, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter of Faith or Practice, may be done with the same facility in the Pulpit, as in the Desk, and with a Text prefixt (as the manner of our Sermons in the present Age is) as well as without one; and then who will not call it a Sermon? I will therefore now conclude Afternoon-Sermons not onely <hi>Antient,</hi> but as they may be managed, strictly enough <hi>Regular</hi> according to the Order of our present Church.</p>
                     <p>Besides such frequent Sermons on the<note place="margin">Sect. 7.</note> Lords Day, it is apparent to any one who reads the Antient Fathers, that there was seldome or never any Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day past without a Sermon, as neither does there any usually at present amongst us in our Cathedral or Collegiate Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or even in our Universities.

<pb n="785" facs="tcp:40528:418"/> were it recommended by Authority; &amp; it would savour of more ingenuity than some mens clancular bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowing others Sermons. That incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable book entreating in each partition usually of some Christian Virtue (&amp; the Saints being exemplary in all virtues) it, would not be unfit intertainment for the people on Saints daies; and I doubt not but the benefit thereof in Publick would be no lesse to the generality, than thousands, not onely persons but families, have found it in private.</p>
                     <p>The Difficulty of provideing <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> so often would indeed be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, but it might easily be alleviated, in Great-townes by a <hi>Combination</hi> or <hi>Rota</hi> of the Neighbouring Clergy, each takeing his turn in course, as it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Masters</hi> in our Universities. Nor does this seem to me at all a Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the <hi>LXXIId</hi> Canon, for here is supposed no new solemnity appointed, onely the law is observed: and as to such Combinations as suggested, how easily may the Approbation of the Diocesan be had thereto? Further, it is not to be forgotten that there are weekly Lectures
<pb n="786" facs="tcp:40528:419"/> settled in several Market-towns▪, which might be well adjourned to the Holy day that falls in the week.</p>
                     <p>Now as to the benefit, in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility it would be very great: Besides the usuall advantages of Sermons gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, this would conciliate some more <hi>regard to Festivalls,</hi> and bring people to the Church thereon: this might also be improved to <hi>instruct</hi> them in the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular designs</hi> of our <hi>Festivalls</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively, the observation whereof they have many of them now little kindnesse for, because they understand not the reason o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>First, multitudes would soon be drawn off by the <hi>Fascinations</hi> of the <hi>Romish Charm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="790" facs="tcp:40528:421"/> Pageantry of Religion, will soon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigle the multitude, which as I have above complained are too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to all Religions, onely one they must have.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, there are another sort of Enemies to our Church on the other hand: We have had too sad experience that <hi>Sedition</hi> and <hi>Rebellion</hi> are as the sin of <hi>Witchraft</hi> in another sense than we ordinarily interpret that speech: they most unreasonably and unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly charm and fascinate the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; and there are not a few men of the old Blade, of a kind of odd Church Militant, who would be sure to set up for preachers, and draw away all those after them, who out of passion &amp; not out of Reason are zealous against Popery.</p>
                     <p>I may safely say, under God, next to our Lawes (for which God be blessed) and our King who maintains the Laws (and whom God long preserve to us) there is nothing hinders more the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency of these two Extremes, from swallowing up in a manner our Church, than does our frequent Preaching.

                        </gap>rt of men for their diversion, and the entertainment of their company. Now there is nothing, which gives a greater check to this growing evill, which really more counter-works these irreligious machinations, than our
<pb n="792" facs="tcp:40528:422"/> frequent preaching does. We should soon see what a dreadfull progresse A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism would make, if while its Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons preach at eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>It may be said perhaps, Popery would hinder this, as well as Protestants preaching; Let but any Religion be in

Now the <hi>infelicity</hi> of liveing in a parish, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veing the charge of a flock, where a man is <hi>not beloved,</hi> is so great, that I do not know, whether any Temporal misery be not to be chosen rather than it: for besides the perpetual <hi>grateing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietudes</hi> of such a life, the troubles such Minister shall be imbroiled in, in getting those small dues on which he is to
<pb n="795" facs="tcp:40528:423"/> subsist, and a thousand like perlexive incidents, he is almost under a necessity of being <hi>unserviceable</hi> to the Souls of his people. Further, we have heard much of the <hi>Contempt of the Clergy,</hi> and many vain and frivolous causes thereof assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned: I may truly name one point, that would bring more contempt and scorn upon us, than perhaps all other put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that is, Let us be <hi>Idle,</hi> or which with the people is the same, let us be <hi>silent</hi> or remit of out constant Preaching. But God be thanked this is imputable to very few, and I hope ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will be to many, of us.</p>
                     <p>I have thus, as in a draught, presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Evills,</hi> which would forth with,<note place="margin">Sect. 12</note> in all probability, ensue, supposeing such Scarity of preaching as is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, and as some men seem to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronise. I have also, with <hi>very</hi> great Freedome and Sincerity, asserted the <hi>Authority of our Preaching,</hi> which though it be not equall to that of the Apostles and of the Inspired age, yet it is as great as the present state of Christianity will admit: Greater it cannot be, except men should be again called, or sent, by
<pb n="796" facs="tcp:40528:424"/> immediate voice from Heaven, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered by Miraculous inspiration: It is really such an Authority, which they have not, who pretend to that <hi>Necessity of Preaching laid upon</hi> them, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed does <hi>ly</hi> upon <hi>Ʋs. Our Office</hi> is of <hi>Divine institution,</hi> and designed to be of <hi>perpetuity,</hi> or of the same duration with the world: The <hi>power</hi> of it is <hi>regularly conveyed</hi> to us by those, who have had it in an <hi>uninterrupted succession</hi> from Christ and his Apostles; and as to our actual <hi>Ministry,</hi> it is not without the special <hi>conduct</hi> and concurrence of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> Finally, as to the various <hi>Modes</hi> there have been of preaching in the World, we are not, blessed be God, much behind any of the Ordinary ages of the Church, and (if it may be spoken without offence) we are superiour to many. What I have to adde by way of conclusion, I shall addresse, with an humble but passionate concernment, to <hi>Preachers and People.</hi>

Let our Arguments have life and energy in them, be such as are apt to create concernment, and it little matters how plain our Language or stile shall be: that which is most natural is certainly most usefull, and to all but Fops and Fantastickes most acceptable. There may be I confess great difference of Auditories, and it is most reasonable that accordingly we consult them; but we are to consider, there are few or no Auditories, which consist not of the Mixed multitude: he therefore that has spoken to the capacity of the meanest, has in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability been understood, in things so spoken, by every one that heard him; and then it is hardly possible, but the generality are bettered. Truth and Godliness can scarce appear in so plain a dress, but they will ever be Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

For they must allow us to be persons sent, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorised by God in an ordinary way, to be their Teachers, and the Guides of their Consciences: and then, if God follow his own institution with his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, if he forget not or neglect his own promise, we must have usually more of the concurrent assistance and conduct of the Holy Ghost▪ in what we teach, than other persons who are not alike cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Office. In proportion here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
<pb n="801" facs="tcp:40528:426"/> there are three or four Particulars which I would passionately press upon our people, and that as they ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any good by our Ministry, and as they would not have our labours rise up in judgment to inhance their everlasting woes. (1.) That they would alwaies come to our Sermons with serious and <hi>single</hi> hearts, not out of Custome, Curiosity, or design of <hi>Censure,</hi> Cavil or the like, but with an honest intention, and sincere desire, either to learn what they know not, or (if they conceive themselves to know enough) to be put in mind, and quickened in the sense of what they know.

                        </gap>.) That they will not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie themselves with the meer having heard a Sermon, and account that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion enough for one day, though they neither heeded, nor, it may be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood five sentences of it. This has been a great Evil of late years; much heard, and nothing applied or digested. People really have looked upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so much the holyer, by how many more Sermons they heard, as some <hi>I</hi> say do for hearing a greater number of Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
<pb n="802" facs="tcp:40528:427"/> Let us beware of this madness, &amp; every one take closely &amp; meekly home to himself, what belongs to him for his good. Reflect not on others, as thus and thus concern'd in the things which are spoken, nor on the Preacher, as too busie or troublesome. In health, you will not be angry with one, who shall bring you an excellent Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; nor in sickness with him, who presents you a sure and safe remedy, neither would you reject either. Have but the same concernment for your souls, as you wear for your bodies, and do in this case, as you would in that. (3.) Whereas in our Sermons, we, for the most part, <hi>shoot</hi> much <hi>at a peradventure,</hi> and being to <hi>hit</hi> the general conditions of men, cannot <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel</hi> alwayes so particularly at some pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate concerns as is needful; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it has been made evident, that the private direction of conscience was one of the Eldest kinds of Preaching, if therefore there be any thing of conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable moment, either <hi>in our Sermons,</hi> which our Auditours have not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, or are not duely satisfied with,
<pb n="803" facs="tcp:40528:427"/> or <hi>in their own conditions,</hi> which we have not touched, let them not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge a foolish modesty to their own injury, but in private have recourse to us for such more particular advice and satisfaction, which <hi>they</hi> need, and we cannot give them in the Pulpit. Lastly, let me humbly crave of our people, that if in any case, their judgments and their Teachers come into competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon equal evidence of Argument on both sides (as they apprehend) they would prefer their Teachers judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before their own. The reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness hereof is founded in this, that the Teacher has <hi>authority</hi> from God, and so may be presumed to have more of the <hi>Divine guidance:</hi> besides, he is <hi>bound,</hi> as he will answer the contrary at Gods great Tribunal, to <hi>teach the Truth,</hi> and nothing but it, to his best knowledge; he has <hi>long given</hi> himself to <hi>search the Truth,</hi> he <hi>sees the dependan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of one Truth on others, and so is better able to determine difficulties by the Analogy or <hi>proportion of Faith,</hi> than such, who perhaps <hi>seeing but few things</hi> comparatively, and not considering all
<pb n="804" facs="tcp:40528:428"/> they see, <hi>easily pronounce</hi> sentence. And as to our <hi>sincerity,</hi> if men will imagine us to have any conscience, they cannot judge us so fond of Errours, as for the love of them, to venture together the damnation of our own souls, and of all those which God will require at our hands.</p>
                     <p>Could we prevail in these few reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable requests, it were to be hoped, our Preaching would have, in a manner, as great success as we could wish: and though we have not the advantage of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration, or Miraculous Gifts, yet our people would not be without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a <hi>Nobler</hi> Faith, than most had even in the inspired times; &amp; particularly they would enjoy the Blessing belonging to those, <hi>who having not seen, have yet believed.</hi> But though we should be so unhappy as not to succeed, yet we may not therefore slacken our Diligence: we know not how soon the case may change, nay, we know not how far we have succeeded already. Sometimes the <hi>seed springs and grows up</hi> no man <hi>knows how.</hi> However, our reward depends not up on our success, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="805" facs="tcp:40528:428"/> our endeavours and fidelity: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing these, <hi>Though Israel be not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, yet shall we be glorious in the eyes of the Lord, and our God shall be our strength.</hi> Possibly we may some of us think this but mean felicity to be safe alone, but in <hi>thus doing</hi> we may reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably hope <hi>to save both our selves, and those that hear us.</hi> And accordingly thou</p>
